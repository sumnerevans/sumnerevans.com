**Disclaimer:** I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from Colorado
School of Mines in Spring 2019. I have also taught classes at both an undergrad
and graduate level at Mines, and thus I have received compensation from Mines.
This post is my opinion only, and does not reflect the position of Mines nor of
any of my other employers.

"Master of Science in Computer Science", it sounds so grand, doesn't it? But is
it worth it? I'm writing this post to give my perspective on whether or not
getting a master's degree is worth the effort and money. I'm assuming that you
are _currently in a computer science undergraduate program_ and are considering
whether or not to continue on to get a computer science master's degree. **I
want to be very clear, this post is my opinion only.**

I will start by saying that I am very happy with my decision to get my master's
in computer science after getting my bachelor's. Mines offers a 4+1 program
which allows you to earn a master's degree by attending for one extra year. For
me, it was one of the best years of my life. I was able to [attend]({{< ref
"../hackathons/hackcu-v/" >}}) and [win]({{< ref
"../hackathons/2018-11-16-facebook-hackathon-the-competition/" >}}) multiple
hackathons, [compete in ICPC]({{< ref "../school/2018-11-03-icpc" >}}), organize
and run the second annual [CS@Mines High School Programming Competition]({{< ref
"../school/2019-hspc.rst" >}}), act as Chair of Mines ACM and Linux Help Guru
for the Mines Linux Users Group, [teach middle and high school students about
computer science]({{< ref "../../portfolio#experience-on-tour" >}}), and
volunteer at Golden High School through the Tau Beta Pi Honor Society (where I
was also the Service Chair for a year), among other things. I did all of this
while being involved in many other activities and clubs including Mines Navs and
intramural soccer. I also had a lot of fun learning about the topics in many of
my courses. I especially benefited from taking Advanced Computer Architecture
which gave me a greater appreciation for how computers work at a hardware level.
Many of the courses deepened my understanding of core computer science concepts,
and this has helped me to be able to provide context to students in my role as
an [adjunct at Mines]({{< ref "../../portfolio#experience-adjunct-mines" >}}).
And on the social side, I did all of this while getting to hang out with some of
my best friends, attend a bunch of Mines Football games, participate in the
annual E-Days cardboard boat race, and do a lot of skiing.

However, I think that from an objective, pure-monetary perspective, I'm at best
no worse off for having done my master's degree than if I had stopped after
undergrad. When accounting for the intangibles of the enjoyment factor and
connections I made, I think I came out ahead, but I attribute very little of my
career success to this point to having received additional education.

# Three Reasons to Get a Master's

I think there are three main reasons why most people decide to get a master's
degree in computer science: financial and academic. However, some also may be
motivated by the social aspects of continuing school.

Probably the most common reason people want to get an advanced computer science
degree is financial. Computer science is one of the fastest growing majors in
the nation right now. It's also one of the most competitive due to the number of
graduates each year. Because of this, people look for many ways to differentiate
themselves from all the other graduates to get the higher-paying jobs. One way
that people do this is by getting a master's degree on addition to their
undergraduate computer science or other engineering degree.

Others see the master's degree as a way to grow academically. Whether their goal
is to become an educator, continue on to a PhD program, become a researcher in
industry or academia, or just generally expand their knowledge of the field,
these people are motivated primarily because they enjoy learning.

Many of the people who pursue master's degrees have a social motivation as well.
Maybe they just want more of the "college experience". Maybe they were able to
do their undergraduate degree in less than the normal four years and want one
extra year before having to get a real job. These people are generally motivated
by one or both of the other reasons, but the social aspect may be the
determining factor if they are on the fence.

In the rest of the article, I am going to examine each one of these reasons in
turn and give you my honest opinion about the merits of that motivation, and
provide you with some things to think about when weighing your options.

# Financial

Many people enter computer science with the goal of finding a high-paying job
right out of college. Many people continue on to get a master's degree in
computer science for the same reason. In this section, I'm going to answer this
question: _does getting a master's degree improve my job offer potential enough
to warrant the cost?_ or stated more simply _is getting a master's degree worth
the money?_.

Most schools that offer a master's program tout higher starting salaries for
master's degree graduates than their undergraduate counterparts. In many cases,
the difference in starting salary is $10k-20k higher for master's graduates. So
the first question is: _are these numbers accurate?_ To be perfectly honest, I
don't know the answer, but I think that it is almost certainly true that people
with master's degrees end up with higher starting salaries. However, the
_reason_ for this is not as straightforward as it may seem.

Schools generally want to attribute the entirety of the starting salary increase
to the additional education received in the master's degree program. However, I
think this is somewhat misleading as there is a great degree of _selection bias_
to account for. Consider the typical student who enters a graduate program. In
most schools you must have a fairly high cumulative GPA to be able to get into a
graduate program. At Mines, for example, you must have received at least a 3.0
GPA in an undergraduate program to be accepted to the graduate program. Thus,
the students who enter the program are at least decent students. Additionally,
anyone who enters a graduate program will at the very least not hate school.
(Most of my undergraduate friends just wanted out after four years and couldn't
imagine themselves doing another year.) Because of these factors, the students
who enter graduate programs are already some of the best, most motivated
students in their undergraduate classes; students that would probably get top
offers right out of a four-year undergraduate degree.

My thesis is that **the primary reason that the starting salary is higher for
graduates with master's degrees is because the calibre of student who enters
such programs would already receive higher-than-average starting salaries if
they did not attend graduate school**. In effect, the natural selection that
occurs getting into the graduate program weeds out the below-average students
(the ones who get mediocre offers) from the equation.

Anecdotally, I know plenty of top undergraduate student students that have
received offers that are equal to or better than offers accepted by some of the
more average graduate students. I have also seen graduate students get very high
offers after getting their master's degree, but I am fairly confident they would
have received a commensurate offer if they entered the job market right after
receiving their bachelor's.

Getting a master's degree is not a silver bullet that will make you a better
computer scientist or software engineer. If you are struggling to get offers
with just your undergraduate degree, you will likely continue to struggle to get
offers once you have an extra line on your resume, and extra piece of paper in a
frame. And if you are getting competitive offers with a bachelor's, you'll get
competitive offers with a master's as well.

So what about you and your decision?

- If you are a top undergraduate student, you will be able to get highly
  competitive offers _without_ a master's degree. And if you are a top
  undergraduate student, you will likely be a top graduate student, so you will
  be able to get similarly highly competitive offers _with_ a master's degree as
  well.

- If you are an average undergraduate student, you will be able to get decent
  offers _without_ a master's degree. You will probably be a below-average
  graduate student, but you will gain some experience and possibly increase your
  chances of getting a better offer once you complete your master's degree.

- If you are a below-average undergraduate student, then you probably won't be
  able to even get into a graduate program. But if you are somehow able to get
  into a graduate program, you'll probably struggle as a graduate student as
  well.

  For these students, getting a master's degree as a way to become more
  employable will be a very stressful and expensive endeavour. You may succeed,
  but there are easier ways to get good offers.

**If the only reason you are thinking of getting a master's degree is so that
you can be more employable, don't get a master's degree. Work on being more
employable.** Getting a master's degree does not make you automatically more
employable. There are much cheaper ways to become more employable including:
getting involved with computer-science related clubs or making open source side
projects and putting them on GitHub.

**If your goal is to increase your employability, always consider options that
don't cost tens of thousands of dollars first.**

.. note::

From a financial standpoint, I think that getting a master's degree makes the
most sense for those who are above average undergraduate students, but not quite
top undergraduate students. These students are at a threshold where companies
may wonder if it's worth taking the risk on hiring them. A master's degree may
act as a "proof" that you are in fact a worthwhile investment, and companies
will be more likely to take a risk and hire you.

- One caveat.

  - Let's say you realized that you weren't a great student in undergrad, and
    maybe your GPA suffered.
  - If you make up your mind to change your mindset and be a better student in
    grad school and get a better GPA or whatever your goal is, companies will
    generally look at the most recent education.
  - They are generally willing to overlook the fact that maybe you partied a
    little too much in undergrad, if you proved in grad school that you can
    apply yourself productively.
  - In my opinion GPA is just a measure of how well you can make yourself do
    something productive.
  - The key here is actually deciding to turn your habits around and be a good
    student, which requires a _lot_ of willpower.

- Opportunity costs:

  - At Colorado School of Mines where I went, the gap between offers for
    undergrad and grad students is around $15k. Which sounds great on the
    surface, but there are a lot of factors that go into this.
  - You could go get a job that makes $70-90k/year with just an undergraduate
    degree.
  - Instead you are spending $20-30k or for your grad degree
  - So say you can make $15k/year more with your grad degree.

    - 100/15 = 6.67 ~= 7 years to recover costs
    - But a clone of yourself who went into the workforce with just
      undergraduate degrees will likely get a raise or bonus in the first year
      out of college (I have friends who have gotten 25% year-over-year pay
      increases, YMMV)
    - If they got a $5000 raise, then you are only $10k ahead, and so it will
      take 10 years to break even.
    - And even this is not guaranteed.
    - In addition, we aren't even taking into account costs like interest on
      student loans, 401k match, company equity, and other benefits like getting
      to put money in an HSA (which is basically investment vehicle for
      health-related costs).

  - In the long run, you will probably end up in about the same place
    financially regardless of whether you go to grad school or not. Basically
    everything equalizes after being in industry for a few years and what
    matters is your performance on the job, not the number of framed pieces of
    paper you own.

  - **If the only reason you are going to grad school is to make more money,
    don't go to grad school. Get to the workforce and start climbing the
    ladder.**

  TODO: economic depression changes this calculus

You may be thinking "Sumner", why would anyone go to grad school! It sounds like
a terrible deal! That's the right question to ask. There are still many sound
reasons for going to grad school.

With making bank due to grad school off the table as the main driving factor for
going to graduate school, let's look at some other reasons that you may want to
go to grad school.

# 2 - Academic

- Many people want to go to grad school so that they increase their breadth or
  depth of knowledge in CS. If that's you, then great!

- Generally, you will touch most of the broad areas of CS in your undergraduate
  program, but maybe you want to go deeper on one of those topics. A Masters
  degree program is the perfect way to do this.

  - For example, maybe you like the mathematical part of computer science, you
    can research algorithms or graph theory, or a variety of other theoretical
    CS topics. If you go this route, you will likely have to go the masters
    thesis route.

  - Or maybe you really liked learning a bit about how the computer actually
    works, then you can go and research or do a project in computer
    architecture.

  - The possibilities are really endless here.

- If increasing your knowledge in a given part of the field is one of your
  goals, then graduate school may be a great opportunity for you.

- In the end, if you are going into Software Engineering, you will likely not
  use a ton of the specific knowledge that you gain in a graduate program. But
  you will have the satisfaction that you are able to better understand the
  foundation on which you are building the products at your job.

- If you want to become an educator, maybe at a middle or high school level,
  then you may want to find a school that has a CS education masters degree
  program.

- If you want to end up in academia or become a distinguished researcher at a
  company, you are going to need to get a PhD, so I wouldn't even bother with
  getting a Masters. Go straight to a PhD program. This is an option that most
  people don't know is possible, but it's entirely a thing.

- If you aren't sure if you want to dedicate 5+ years to a PhD right after your
  undergrad, I recommend just getting a job and working in industry for a few
  years and then going to get a PhD. I have a friend who has done that (realized
  after a few years in industry that he wanted to get a PhD and is going to be
  starting in Fall 2021)

- As you can see, there are many academic reasons for getting a masters degree.
  If any of those rang a bell, then you should seriously consider going for a CS
  Masters degree.

# 3 - Social

- A lot of people don't talk about the social aspect of school as a primary
  reason for getting a masters degree, but it's a real, valid reason.

- I don't just mean continue going to all the parties, either. One extra year of
  connections with like-minded people can be extremely valuable. You will
  probably run into alumni of your alma mater many times throughout your career
  in the weirdest places.

- Friends/clubs/etc

  - I was involved with Navigators (Christian ministry), ACM (as the Chair), and
    LUG, Tau Beta Pi (honor society) and wanted to continue being a part of
    those organizations.
  - I wanted to go to all of the football games (somethnig that I didn't do
    during undergrad very often) and generally participate in all of the crazy
    things that I neglected during undergrad.
  - I had just turned 21. Need I say more?

- If you are ahead in school (I was 2 years ahead), having an extra year of
  college experience is often worth it.

- If you are even just a semester ahead, you will end up going to school for
  only more semester compared to your peers who are just getting a BS degree.
  This requires that you actually like school, though.

# Conclusion

- From this, you may think that I have regrets about my decision to do grad
  school, this is entirely false. I loved it (it was hard at times, but overall
  one of the best years of my life so far).

- But I want to give you an accurate picture of both the benefits and
  opportunities as well as the costs associated with getting a masters so that
  you can actually make an educated decision: not just a decision based off of
  marketing from <insert school here>.

The bottom line:

- If you think you'll be miserable during grad school (either financially,
  academically, or socially), don't do it.

- If you are going to be fine financially, are interested in the academic side
  of CS, and/or just want to be in school for another year, then go for it!
