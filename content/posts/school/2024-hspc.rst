For the last six years, Mines ACM has hosted a High School Programming
Competition (HSPC) modelled after the `International Collegiate Programming
Contest (ICPC) <icpc_>`_. I wrote about the `2019 <hspc2019_>`_, `2020
<hspc2020_>`_, `2021 <hspc2021_>`_, `2022 <hspc2022_>`_, and `2023 <hspc2023_>`_
competitions on this blog. The problems from every year are new and written by
Mines students and some Mines alum specifically for the competition. This year,
I wrote two of the problems, reviewed all of them, and helped Ethan Richards
with organizing the competition.

This year, we returned to an in-person only competition, however we opened up an
open division to remote competitors. We also continued our open-internet policy
which allowed students to access internet resources.

New this year, we decided to give special awards for teams consisting of
exclusively first-time competitors.

We had sixteen different problems written by eleven authors (the highest number
of authors ever).

The in-person competition featured 37 teams making it the largest in-person
competition to-date.

In this post, I'm going to explain the problems in the competition (with
relatively detailed solution sketches).

.. Competition Highlights
.. ======================

**You can view full standings for each competition at the following websites:**

* In-Person: https://mines-hspc.kattis.com/contests/mines-hspc24
* Open: https://mines-hspc.kattis.com/contests/mines-hspc24-open

.. As with all of the HSPC competitions so far, this year's competition was very
.. exciting.

.. Highlights from the advanced in-person competition include:

.. TOTO

.. Highlights from the beginner in-person competition include:

.. TODO

.. Highlights from the advanced remote competition include:

.. * River Hill High School, the winners of the 2021 competition who placed third
..   last year, regained the title winning first place. They solved all twelve
..   problems to beat Cherry Creek High School's remote team.
.. * Cherry Creek High School (last year's third-place winners) solved all twelve
..   problems, but lost on the time tiebreaker to River Hill.
.. * New participants Bergen County Academics with their team *JMS* took third
..   place solving eleven problems.
.. * River Hill was first to solve seven of the problems, while Cherry Creek were
..   first to solve on two problems. Bergen County's team was first to solve on two
..   problems. Team *Triangle* (5th) out of Voice of Calling NPO in of Northridge,
..   California were first to solve on a problem as well.

The Problems
============

.. warning::

   The rest of this post should be treated like a solutions manual. I hope that
   this is an extremely helpful resource when you get stuck, but you should
   *try* to solve each of the problems before reading the solutions. There's no
   magic amount of time that you should try to solve the problem before looking
   at the solution sketch, but I think a good rule of thumb is after you've
   tried at least three ideas on your own, then you can read at the solution
   sketch.

   **Remember: You will not learn anything if you just read the explanations!**

There were sixteen problems in the competition written by eleven different
authors (the most ever). The problems can be viewed at
https://mines-hspc.kattis.com/contests/mines-hspc24/problems. The following
lists the problems featured in the competition and a short description of the
algorithm required to solve the problem, listed in the order in which they
appeared in competition:

**Beginner Competition:**

- **A: Parking Pandemonium** -- Basic arithmetic.
- **B: Closing Early** -- Modular arithmetic in a ``for`` loop.
- **C: Clock Catchup** -- Modular arithmetic related to time.
- **D: New Professor** -- Priority-queue or repeatedly sorted list processing.
- **E: Exact Change** -- Modular arithmetic.
- **F: Win Streak** -- List processing.
- **G: Winning Wagers** -- Expected value.
- **H: Warehouse Stocking** -- Dictionary and reverse-lookup dictionary.
- **I: Trolley Troubles** -- 0-1 BFS or Dijkstra's.
- **J: M-Climb Road** -- Basic arithmetic.
- **K: Purchasing Perishables** -- Finding optimal sequential-window size in a
  list.
- **L: Abby's Absolutes** -- Inequality check in a ``for`` loop.
- **M: Mines Motor Company** -- Manhattan distances in a ``for`` loop.
- **N: No Stragglers** -- Keep track of single variable state in a ``for`` loop.
- **O: QWERTY** -- Cipher based
- **P: Procrastination** -- 

The following subsections are going to describe the problems and provide fairly
detailed solution sketches for each one, sorted by their intended relative
difficulty with the easiest ones first.

I do not try and build up from first principles in each of these explanations.
Rather, I try and make the explanations accessible to anyone who feels like
solving the problem is within their grasp, but they can't figure out one or two
of the key ideas to crack the problem. For the easiest problems, I start much
closer to first principles, but as the problems get harder, I start assuming
more and more base understanding of programming.

Additionally, I'm only presenting a single solution for each problem here. There
are likely many alternative ways to solve each of these problems.

Parking Pandemonium

:Concept: basic operations on variables

.. admonition:: Problem Summary

   Calculate the amount of times it takes for Hannah to find a parking spot
   given that she circles the lot `C` times at `M` minutes per circle.

The solution is to read the first and third lines of input and multiply them.
The only difficult thing here is ignoring the second line of input which is the
temperature of the parking lot in Kelvin.

.. admonition:: Problem Summary

   **Will Rishi make it to the end of the intersection before the light turns
   red given he is going at $S$ miles per hour?** He is `D` feet from the end of
   the intersection and he has `T` seconds to get through the intersection.

For this problem, you need to determine if Rishi will travel at least `D` feet
in `T` seconds going at `S` miles per hour.

You need to do some unit conversions in order to make this comparison. It is
recommended to convert the speed to feet per second.

Then if `T \times S \geq D` Rishi "MADE IT" otherwise output "FAILED TEST".
