   I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from Colorado School of Mines
   in Spring 2019. I have also taught classes at both an undergrad and graduate
   level at Mines, and thus I have recieved compensation from Mines.

I think there are three main reasons why most people decide to get a master's
degree in computer science: financial, academic, and social.

In this article, I'm going to examine each one of these reasons in turn and give
you my honest opinion. TODO

1 - Financial
=============

Many people enter computer science with the goal of finding a high-paying job
right out of college. Many people continue on to get a master's degree in
computer science for the same reason.

* They want to make more money in their job out of college.

  * A lot of schools tout the higher starting salaries

* There's some truth to this. Personally, I got a great offer right out of
  college. And I know quite a few of my peers who got their Masters got great
  offers as well.
* However, I know a lot of undergraduate students that have gotten offers that
  are similar or even higher to those of some of the graduate students that I
  know.
* The thing is, **Grad school is not a magic pill that will make you a better
  Computer Scientist or Software Engineer**
* Students who are top undergraduate students will be able to get very
  competitive offers without a Master's.
* Students who are top graduate students will be able to get the top offers.
* So if you are a top student, you will likely get a great offer with a Master's
  degree, but you could get a really *good* offer with just a Bachelor's.
* On the other hand, students who are struggling to find an internship or job
  with just an undergraduate degree will likely continue to struggle to find an
  internship or job, even with the extra line on your resume, and extra piece of
  paper.
* Having a masters degree does not make you automatically more employable.
* **If the only reason you are thinking of grad school is so that you can be
  more employable, don't go to grad school. Work on being more employable.**

  * Maybe you need to get involved with some computer science related clubs on
    campus.
  * Maybe you need to do some side projects and put them on GitHub.
  * There are tons of ways to make yourself more employable, and you can find
    tons of advice here on YouTube.
  * If your goal is increasing your employability, then look to things that
    don't cost tens of thousands of dollars per year year in tuition.
  * I know many friends who weren't exceptional students during undergrad (they
    got good grades, but not great) but who did tons of things to make
    themselves employable (involement in student/professional orgs and such) and
    got really good offers right out of school.

  * One caveat.

    * Let's say you realized that you weren't a great student in undergrad, and
      maybe your GPA suffered.
    * If you make up your mind to change your mindset and be a better student in
      grad school and get a better GPA or whatever your goal is, companies will
      generally look at the most recent education.
    * They are generally willing to overlook the fact that maybe you partied a
      little too much in undergrad, if you proved in grad school that you can
      apply yourself productively.
    * In my opinion GPA is just a measure of how well you can make yourself do
      something productive.
    * The key here is actually deciding to turn your habits around and be a good
      student, which requires a *lot* of willpower.

* Opportunity costs:

  * At Colorado School of Mines where I went, the gap between offers for
    undergrad and grad students is around $15k. Which sounds great on the
    surface, but there are a lot of factors that go into this.
  * You could go get a job that makes $70-90k/year with just an undergraduate
    degree.
  * Instead you are spending $20-30k or for your grad degree
  * So say you can make $15k/year more with your grad degree.

    * 100/15 = 6.67 ~= 7 years to recover costs
    * But a clone of yourself who went into the workforce with just
      undergraduate degrees will likely get a raise or bonus in the first year
      out of college (I have friends who have gotten 25% year-over-year pay
      increases, YMMV)
    * If they got a $5000 raise, then you are only $10k ahead, and so it will
      take 10 years to break even.
    * And even this is not guaranteed.
    * In addition, we aren't even taking into account costs like interest on
      student loans, 401k match, company equity, and other benefits like getting
      to put money in an HSA (which is basically investment vehicle for
      health-related costs).

  * In the long run, you will probably end up in about the same place
    financially regardless of whether you go to grad school or not. Basically
    everything equalizes after being in industry for a few years and what
    matters is your performance on the job, not the number of framed pieces of
    paper you own.

  * **If the only reason you are going to grad school is to make more money,
    don't go to grad school. Get to the workforce and start climbing the
    ladder.**

You may be thinking "Sumner", why would anyone go to grad school! It sounds like
a terrible deal! That's the right question to ask. There are still many sound
reasons for going to grad school.

With making bank due to grad school off the table as the main driving factor for
going to graduate school, let's look at some other reasons that you may want to
go to grad school.

2 - Academic
============

* Many people want to go to grad school so that they increase their breadth or
  depth of knowledge in CS. If that's you, then great!

* Generally, you will touch most of the broad areas of CS in your undergraduate
  program, but maybe you want to go deeper on one of those topics. A Masters
  degree program is the perfect way to do this.

  * For example, maybe you like the mathematical part of computer science, you
    can research algorithms or graph theory, or a variety of other theoretical
    CS topics. If you go this route, you will likely have to go the masters
    thesis route.

  * Or maybe you really liked learning a bit about how the computer actually
    works, then you can go and research or do a project in computer
    architecture.

  * The possibilities are really endless here.

* If increasing your knowledge in a given part of the field is one of your
  goals, then graduate school may be a great opportunity for you.

* In the end, if you are going into Software Engineering, you will likely not
  use a ton of the specific knowledge that you gain in a graduate program. But
  you will have the satisfaction that you are able to better understand the
  foundation on which you are building the products at your job.

* If you want to become an educator, maybe at a middle or high school level,
  then you may want to find a school that has a CS education masters degree
  program.

* If you want to end up in academia or become a distinguished researcher at a
  company, you are going to need to get a PhD, so I wouldn't even bother with
  getting a Masters. Go straight to a PhD program.  This is an option that most
  people don't know is possible, but it's entirely a thing.

* If you aren't sure if you want to dedicate 5+ years to a PhD right after your
  undergrad, I recommend just getting a job and working in industry for a few
  years and then going to get a PhD. I have a friend who has done that (realized
  after a few years in industry that he wanted to get a PhD and is going to be
  starting in Fall 2021)

* As you can see, there are many academic reasons for getting a masters degree.
  If any of those rang a bell, then you should seriously consider going for a CS
  Masters degree.

3 - Social
==========

* A lot of people don't talk about the social aspect of school as a primary
  reason for getting a masters degree, but it's a real, valid reason.

* I don't just mean continue going to all the parties, either. One extra year of
  connections with like-minded people can be extremely valuable. You will
  probably run into alumni of your alma mater many times throughout your career
  in the weirdest places.

* Friends/clubs/etc

  * I was involved with Navigators (Christian ministry), ACM (as the Chair), and
    LUG, Tau Beta Pi (honor society) and wanted to continue being a part of
    those organizations.
  * I wanted to go to all of the football games (somethnig that I didn't do
    during undergrad very often) and generally participate in all of the crazy
    things that I neglected during undergrad.
  * I had just turned 21. Need I say more?

* If you are ahead in school (I was 2 years ahead), having an extra year of
  college experience is often worth it.

* If you are even just a semester ahead, you will end up going to school for
  only more semester compared to your peers who are just getting a BS degree.
  This requires that you actually like school, though.

Conclusion
==========

* From this, you may think that I have regrets about my decision to do grad
  school, this is entirely false. I loved it (it was hard at times, but overall
  one of the best years of my life so far).

* But I want to give you an accurate picture of both the benefits and
  opportunities as well as the costs associated with getting a masters so that
  you can actually make an educated decision: not just a decision based off of
  marketing from <insert school here>.

The bottom line:

* If you think you'll be miserable during grad school (either financially,
  academically, or socially), don't do it.

* If you are going to be fine financially, are interested in the academic side
  of CS, and/or just want to be in school for another year, then go for it!
