  I would like to put forward my endorsements for the 2025 Matrix Governing
  Board elections.

<div class="admonition important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Disclaimer</p>
<p class="last">

I would like to make it clear that **these endorsements are my opinions only**.
They do not reflect the opinion of the Matrix Governing Board which I am
currently a member of, nor do they reflect the opinions of my current or past
employers.

I have decided that I will not stand again in this year's [Matrix Governing
Board elections](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board-elections/2025/).
I recently
[joined Can/Am Technologies as a tech lead]({{<ref"../../portfolio/index.html#experience-canam-tech-lead">}})
and I do not feel like I can dedicate a sufficient amount of time to be a good
board member. Thus, I have decided to step aside and let others have a chance to
take on the challenge of governance.

I would like to make a few endorsements for the upcoming elections.

## Greg Sutcliffe

I endorse **Greg Sutcliffe** to represent Individual Members on the Board.

Greg has served as the Chair of the Governing Board and has been essential to
the Board's current success. He has been instrumental in writing the bylaws
establishing the processes by which the Board operates. His experience with
governance across a variety of open source projects is invaluable to the Matrix
Governing Board. In his role as Chair, he meets regularly with the Vice Chair
(Kim Brose aka HarHarLinks) and the Managing Director of the Matrix.org
Foundation (Robin Riley).

In addition to his role as Chair of the Board, Greg is a member and active
participant of multiple committees. For example, he is a member of the Community
Committee which I have chaired since its inception.

I wholeheartedly endorse Greg. If he were not re-elected, it would be a great
blow to the smooth operation of the Governing Board.

## Brad Murray

I endorse **Brad Murray** representing Automattic as a Gold Member candidate.

I had the pleasure of working with Brad for four years at Beeper (acquired by
Automattic). I reported directly to him for about half of that time, and he was
my skip-manager for the other half.

Brad always led Beeper towards using Matrix to back our features by utilizing
custom rooms and events. He also pushed for us to upstream our contributions to
Synapse and implement more Matrix features in mautrix-go and other open source
projects rather than in our proprietary SDK.

I trust Brad as a leader, and put my full endorsement behind him.
