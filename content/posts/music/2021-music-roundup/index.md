Last year I found some great new music, and I wanted to do a quick roundup to
just talk about some of the songs that I really enjoyed last year.

# Worship Music

I'll start by talking about a few really great worship songs that I found last
year.

* ***Ancient of Days*** by *City Alight* --- This song proclaims the glory and
  sovereignty of God. It's rising chorus is declares Him above all things.

* ***The Lord is My Salvation*** by *Keith and Kristyn Getty* ---

* Christ Our Hope In Life And Death (Keith and Kristyn Getty & Matt Papa)
* O Praise The Name (Hillsong Worship)

# Country Music

* Justin Moore (Late Nights and Longnecks)

  * That's My Boy --- I really enjoyed the fatherly love for his son expressed
    in the song.
  * Never Gonna Drink Again --- one of my favorite things in songwriting is
    wordplay. The chorus of this song has a really cool lyrical twist.
  * Jesus and Jack Daniels

* Justin More (Straight Outta The Country)

  * Consecutive Days Alive --- a reflection on all the crazy things that he's
    done, and he's just glad that he's still alive.
  * She Ain't Mine No More --- just a banger of a breakup song

* Justin Moore (Kinda Don't Care)

  * Kinda Don't Care
  * You Look Like I Need A Drink

* Rodney Atkins

  * He's Mine --- It's about the unconditional love of a father for his son,
    even when he gets in trouble.
  * Cleaning This Gun (Come On In Boy) --- about meeting her parents
  * Thank God For You --- is a great song about how his love rescued him from
    being a wild boy

* Blake Shelton

  * Minimum Wage --- controversy was stupid
  * Austin --- classic that I discovered

* Jon Pardi

  * Ain't Always The Cowboy

* Morgan Wallen

  * Dangerous was really good, and More Than My Hometown was one of the best.
  * Really enjoyed Silverado For Sale

  * hole in the bottle --- really funny, upbeat song about drinking away your
    breakup sorrows.

* Cody Jinks

  * Give All You Can
  * The Way I Am

* Chris Jansen

* Parker McCollum

  * Pretty Heart --- song about how he's sad that he broke his love's heart.

* Riley Green

  * If It Wasn't For Trucks ---

* The Wreckers

  * Leave The Pieces --- Another classic I discovered this year. Really love the
    harmonies.

* Brad Paisley + Allison Krauss

  * Whiskey Lullaby --- such a beautifully sad song with amazing harmonies.

* Allan Jackson

  * Livin' On Love --- love the lyrics "livin' on love, buyin' on time"

* Luke Combs

  * Forever After All --- really love how he talks about how he imagines himself
    being together with his wife forever.
  * Cold As You --- total banger

* Lee Brice

  * One Of them Girls --- a bit of a classic that I missed
  * Rumor

    boy who passed away

    vocalist. Red has long been one of my favorite songs, so that is still
    probably my favorite from the new album
