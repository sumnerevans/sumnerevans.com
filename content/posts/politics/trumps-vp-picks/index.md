Who a presidential candidate chooses as their running mate is one of the most
consequential decisions of the campaign. If done poorly, vice presidential picks
can greatly hurt a presidential campaign. Often, the vice presidential pick
doesn't really move the needle for the campaign, and the VP is soon forgotten.
But every once in a while the presidential candidate chooses a candidate who
bolsters the ticket by solidifying support for the candidate or bringing in
votes from a demographic that the president is not strong in.

I've been "politically conscious" since the 2008 election between Barack Obama
and John McCain. In that election, Obama made an excellent VP choice in Joe
Biden which solidified support from establishment Democrats who were wary of the
junior senator's lack of experience. On the other hand, John McCain chose Sarah
Palin who was probably the worst VP candidate of the five elections I've
followed. She was an inexperienced pick and turned out to be a massive gaffe
machine throughout the campaign. During the debate with Joe Biden, she did
nothing to quell the fears of her inexperience. She would have had to win the
debate convincingly to restore her image, but most pundits agree that Biden won
the debate (though not by the margins many expected).

During the 2012 election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Biden was still
the vice president, so only Mitt Romney had to choose a running mate. He chose
Paul Ryan, another inexperienced pick. I remember watching in horror as Biden
destroyed Ryan during the vice presidential debate.
