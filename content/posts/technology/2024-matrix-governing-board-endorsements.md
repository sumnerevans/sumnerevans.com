  I would like to endorse a Kim Brose and Nicolas Werner (Nico) as ecosystem
  member candidates for the Matrix Governing Board.

I'm running for the Matrix Governing Board as an Individual Member (see my
[Platform]({{<ref"./2024-matrix-governing-board.md">}})) and I am only eligible
to vote as an individual member, but I would like to endorse a few Ecosystem
Member candidates who are well qualified to represent the ecosystem.

## Kim Brose

I endorse **Kim Brose (HarHarLinks)** representing Matrix Community Events as an
Ecosystem Member candidate.

I met Kim in Berlin at the
[first Community Matrix Summit]({{<ref"../travel/2022-berlin-matrix-summit/summit/index.md">}})
and has been active in organizing many other Matrix community events including
the
[2023]({{<ref"../travel/2023-fosdem/fosdem/index.md#the-matrix-community-meetup">}})
and
[2024]({{<ref"../travel/2024-fosdem/fosdem/index.md#matrix-community-meetup">}})
Matrix Community Meetups at FOSDEM. He is a great community builder and is
consistently welcoming to newcomers at the events. His Matrix pedigree is also
deep and includes running a homeserver for multiple people, contributing to the
[simplematrixbotlib](https://github.com/imbev/simplematrixbotlib), and
contributions to many other projects. He also works on widgets is his role at
Nordeck. Kim would provide a valuable perspective on the Matrix ecosystem as he
has been involved so many aspects of our community.

## Nico

I endorse **Nico (Nicolas Werner)** representing Nheko as an Ecosystem Member
candidate.

I met Nico in Berlin at the
[first Community Matrix Summit]({{<ref"../travel/2022-berlin-matrix-summit/summit/index.md">}})
although I'd know of him much before that through his work on Nheko. Nheko is
one of the most fully-featured non-Element clients in the ecosystem. The Nheko
project has led to many Spec clarifications and improvements and continues to
stress-test the viability of new proposals. The Client-Server API often feels
like it was designed by backend developers who are guessing at how clients will
be implemented. However, there are many things that can be done to the CSAPI
that will improve client developers experience. Having strong client
representation on the Governing board will ensure that clients have a seat at
the table in discussions about the priorities of Matrix.
