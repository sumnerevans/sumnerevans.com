Today I went to Bruges, a beautiful city near the Belgian coast. I woke up a bit
late (I still haven't really adjusted to the CEST timezone), but I managed to
get to Bruges by around 11 in the morning. I enjoy trains, and I got to take the
train from Bruxeles-Midi through Ghent and on to Bruges.

I'd skipped breakfast, so by the time I arrived in the city centre, I was hungry
and went to a restaurant called
[De Beurze](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xsqv4zeMx45H98bj8). It was a cosy place,
with a little fireplace that I sat next to. I had a nice steak with salad and
fries, all while having a great view of the main square. I really enjoy the way
that they do service in Europe. Nobody comes to bug you while you're eating, but
they are attentive and you can easily flag the wait staff down if you need
anything. I don't like that you have to pay for the water, though. But it gives
me an excuse to order sparkling water since it's the same price as still.
Additionally, since the US Dollar is so strong against the Euro right now, the
prices are also very reasonable. I think it was 1.08 USD to 1 EUR while I was
there.

After lunch, I went across the square to Belfort (the Belfry), which is a large
bell tower.

After the bell tower, I continued walking around the town.
