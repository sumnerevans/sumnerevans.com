To celebrate the end of my senior year, I am going on trip with my mom to New
England. We will be going to New York City, Boston and then taking a cruise
which goes to Bermuda, back to Boston, and then to Bar Harbor, Maine; Halifax,
Nova Scotia, Canada; Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada; Charlottetown, Prince Edward
Island; Quebec City, Quebec, Canada; and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. A few days of
the cruise we will be cruising the St. Lawrence River. We will spend a day or
two in Montreal and then fly to Atlanta where we will meet Hannah and spend time
with friends and family in Georgia.

I will be writing a post every day of the trip until at least Montreal.  I may
or may not continue after that. I'm not sure what my connection will be like on
the ship, so it may be a few days between posts.
