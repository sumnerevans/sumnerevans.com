  After waking up late, I spend a half day in Prague exploring the city.

I woke up very late today (like 14h). I guess I needed some sleep after my crazy
train ordeal yesterday. It was kinda sleeting anyway, so I didn't feel that bad
about missing out on the morning.

I was hungry, so I started walking to find somewhere to eat. I ran across a
restaurant that looked like it served local fare, and I got their beef goulash.
I ordered with "dumplings" which were the bread slices. I think I should have
tried with the wild rice instead.

After my late lunch, I walked towards the centre, passing a few squares and nice
streets on the way.

I went to the clocktower and decided to get a ticket to go up and see the view.
I always like going up any towers that are open to tourists because they always
have good views. This one was no different.

After going up the tower, I walked down through the city towards the Vltava
River enjoying the pretty old town.

I arrived at the river, and there was a really good view of the other side.

There is a really cool pedestrian bridge that I walked towards. It seems like
it's the most famous bridge in Prague. My parents have a few art pieces that
depict the bridge, and so it was cool to actually go and see it.

After walking across the bridge, it was getting dark and cold, so I decided to
go back to the hostel to relax. After a few hours back at the hostel working on
my blog and preparing for my flight to FOSDEM tomorrow, I was quite hungry. One
of the hostel employees had brought in their dinner from a Vietnamese
restaurant. I learned from her that there is a sizeable Vietnamese immigrant
population in Prague. She recommended one of them, and so I went and got some
phở. Considering how snowy it is this evening, the soup hit the spot.

I clearly did not plan my day very well. I feel like I just got a small taste of
Prague. I want to return at some point, maybe during summertime.
