  On my way to FOSDEM, I flew into London for a few days before taking the
  Eurostar to Brussels for the conference.

I once again am making a trip across the pond for FOSDEM. This time, instead of
flying to Brussels, I chose to fly to London a few days early and then take the
Eurostar to Brussels. The nice thing about this itinerary is that I was able to
take a direct flight from Denver to London, Heathrow. The flight was not very
full, and I ended up with a whole row to myself!

I arrived in London around 10:30 in the morning. Getting to my hotel was a
matter of taking a few underground trains to the Lambeth North station. The Tube
is so easy to navigate, and my hotel
([Point A London, Westminster](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AFWHcWM8eihLX8ns6)) was
literally right across the street from the Lambeth North station. I arrived at
around noon, and was delighted to discover that my room was already available. I
was quite tired after the long trip, and so I took a nap for about an hour.

At this point, I was pretty hungry. I ventured out into the drizzle to find a
restaurant for lunch. I found
[Enough to Feed an Elephant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aahu8TSXG2MiDLf27) which
has good ratings, but I was unimpressed with the service (it was very slow) and
the food was not what I expected (so that's on me). It was calories though, and
I felt somewhat rejuvenated after eating.

## Tate Modern

After lunch, I headed over to the
[Tate Modern](https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern). I'm not really a big
fan of modern art, but I figured I should go to up my elite street cred. I
stayed for a little over an hour before I got bored and decided to do something
else.

Here were a couple of things in the museum that I thought were kinda cool.

## St. Paul's Cathedral

The Tate Modern is right across the river from St. Paul's Cathedral, so I looked
to see if there was a church service going on. There was a Sunday evening
service happening, so I went and attended it. You can't take pictures during the
service, but it was a nice service right under the dome.

I was still quite tired after my travel for the day, so I took the Tube back to
Lambeth North, found some food and then turned in for the night.

## The British Museum

On Monday, I slept in and then I went to the British Museum, arriving around
11:30.
