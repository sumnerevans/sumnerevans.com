  This week, Beeper (which is now the Messaging division of Automattic) had our
  four-day 2024 Q2 work retreat in Porto, Portugal. These are my thoughts and
  reflections on the trip.

The past few weeks have been exciting for Beeper. We
[made Beeper available to everyone without a
waitlist](https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-now-available/),
[launched a new Android app based on our own internally-built Matrix SDK written
in Go](https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/how-beeper-android-works/), and
[were acquired by Automattic](https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-joining-automattic/)
for
[$125M](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/wordpress-com-owner-automattic-acquires-multi-service-messaging-app-beeper-for-125m/).
As part of the acquisition, the Beeper team is merging with the
[Texts.com](http://texts.com/) that was acquired by Automattic last year. We are
going to unify the products under the Beeper brand. All of this is only a few
months on the heels of our
[Beeper Mini launch](https://blog.beeper.com/2023/12/05/introducing-beeper-mini-get-blue-bubbles-on-android-%f0%9f%92%99/)
which brought fully end-to-end encrypted iMessage to Android devices.

Like Beeper, Automattic is a [remote-only company](https://automattic.com/about)
and so is the Texts.com team, so work retreats are the only time that we can
connect with our co-workers in-person and build stronger personal relationships
with among the team. This retreat felt especially necessary because we are
combining two teams together and we wanted to build personal relationships
across the previously separate teams.

Our destination for this retreat was Porto, Portugal. We've had a [retreat in
Portugal before]({{< ref "/posts/travel/2022-lisbon-and-paris/ericeira-portugal"
>}}), but not in Porto. We also have had retreats in [Montreal]({{< ref
"/posts/travel/2021-dc-montreal/2021-09-13-17-montreal" >}}), [Playa del
Carmen]({{< ref "/posts/travel/2022-playa-del-carmen-mexico" >}}), [Mexico
City]({{< ref "/posts/travel/2022-mexico-city-retreat" >}}), [Amsterdam]({{< ref
"/posts/travel/2023-amsterdam-retreat/retreat" >}}), and most recently in
[Toronto]({{< ref "/posts/travel/2023-toronto-retreat" >}}) last fall.

## The Venue

The meeting area was on the hotel grounds about a hundred yards from the front
of the hotel. It consisted of two main rooms: one with circular tables and one
with couches and chairs and an array of snacks and coffee. It was very fancy
compared to our previous retreat, which makes sense because a whole event team
had been there for a few days before our meetup. They had nametags and swag
ready for us when we arrived and there was a whole big AV setup with TVs and
video equipment. They had tables set up for everyone and a small stage in the
front. This is definitely a benefit of being at a larger company: we have actual
teams that organize larger retreats instead of it just being Eric all of the
time (not that he did a bad job, but his bandwidth was not primarily dedicated
to making arrangements for the retreats).

TODO PICS

The hotel itself was very nice as well. The room was large and luxurious and the
hotel's restaurant was high quality. We had breakfast every day at the
restaurant (well, we being the general "we", I skipped breakfast a couple days
due to sleeping in too much) and they also provided lunch and a few dinners.

## Getting to Know Everyone

In addition to the Beeper and Texts teams, there were quite a few Automatticians
in attendance who helped facilitate team-building and integration into
Automattic. My goal for the week was to have at least one memorable conversation
with everyone from the Texts.com team and get to know some fun fact about them
other than just where they're from and what they work on.
