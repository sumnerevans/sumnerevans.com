  This week, Beeper (which is now the Messaging division of Automattic) had our
  four-day 2024 Q2 work retreat in Porto, Portugal. These are my thoughts and
  reflections on the trip.

On the Saturday after the [retreat]({{< ref "../retreat/index.md" >}}) I did my
own sightseeing and adventuring around Porto. However, as I mentioned in my
[post about the retreat]({{< ref "../retreat/index.md#walking-tour" >}}), a
bunch of us went on a walking tour of the city on Wednesday, but since it wasn't
really meetup-related, I decided to combine the info that I got on the tour with
this post, as I think it fits better.

## Walking Tour

Our tour guide was a Porto native, and took us to some of the main sights in the
city. He started by talking about the history of Porto and the centuries-old
rivalry between Porto (which is in northern Portugal) and Lisbon (in the south).
Porto was one of the first cities liberated during the Iberian Reconquista and
became the regional seat of power for both the Catholic Church and later the
Portuguese king. Porto was so important that the country of Portugal was named
after the city. However, as the Reconquista moved south during the eleventh
through the thirteenth centuries, the power centre moved south and by 1255
became the capital of Portugal. Today, the rivalry is most evident in the
football rivalries, and in the beer that is served in each city with Super Bock
being the primary beer of Porto and Sagres being more popular in Lisbon (though
I was able to find both in Lisbon [when I was there a few years ago]({{< ref
"../../2022-lisbon-and-paris/lisbon-day2/index.md" >}})).

One of the first stops that we made was at a McDonald's that is inside of a very
famous
