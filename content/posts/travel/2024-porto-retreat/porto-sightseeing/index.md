On the Saturday after the [retreat]({{< ref "../retreat/index.md" >}}) I did my
own sightseeing and adventuring around Porto. However, as I mentioned in my
[post about the retreat]({{< ref "../retreat/index.md#walking-tour" >}}), a
bunch of us went on a walking tour of the city on Wednesday, but since it wasn't
really meetup-related, I decided to combine the info that I got on the tour with
this post, as I think it fits better.

## Walking Tour

Our tour guide was a Porto native, and took us to some of the main sights in the
city. He started by talking about the history of Porto and the centuries-old
rivalry between Porto (which is in northern Portugal) and Lisbon (in the south).
Porto was one of the first cities liberated during the Iberian Reconquista and
became the regional seat of power for both the Catholic Church and later the
Portuguese king. Porto was so important that the country of Portugal was named
after the city. However, as the Reconquista moved south during the eleventh
through the thirteenth centuries, the power centre moved south and by 1255
became the capital of Portugal. Today, the rivalry is most evident in the
football rivalries, and in the beer that is served in each city with Super Bock
being the primary beer of Porto and Sagres being more popular in Lisbon (though
I was able to find both in Lisbon
[when I was there a few years ago]({{<ref"../../2022-lisbon-and-paris/lisbon-day2/index.md">}})).

One of the first stops that we made was at a McDonald's that is inside of a very
famous historic cafe. McDonalds restored the old cafe, but they had to leave the
exterior untouched, and keep most of the interior the same as well. It was a
very beautiful building, just wish that it wasn't a McDonald's :).

The next stop was at the Porto train station. The entrance is decorated with
intricate painted ceramic tiles. The main facades depict military conquests and
other historical events such as the arrival of the English king to form an
alliance with the Portuguese. Above the main murals are murals depicting the
evolution of transportation from horse and carriage to the train.

We then walked up a hill to the highest point in the city. There is a famous
church with a belltower (I went up it on Saturday) and a large square. Around
the square are multiple important buildings such as a jail that was originally
for violent criminals (they would actually perform public hangings of convicted
criminals in the square outside the jail. The jail was converted to a political
prison during the Salazar dictatorship, and after the dictatorship fell, they
converted it to a museum of photography.

On the other side of the square was a courthouse built during the dictatorship.
Outside of the building is a statue of Lady Justice, our guide pointed out that
she is not blind, her sword is out in front, not by her side, and she grasps an
unbalanced scale of justice in her hand. I'm not sure if Salazar requested this,
or if the sculptor was trying to send a subliminal message, but it serves as a
reminder of what perverted justice can cause.

Along the walking tour, we walked along many pretty streets. This one in
particular caught my eye for its vibrant colours:

## Cleric's Tower

On Saturday, after the retreat was over, I spent the day sightseeing. A was
staying at [_Residencial Bragan√ßa_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f5UmwULLZHZtKhk97)
and it was literally a stone's throw away from the Cleric's tower and church. I
didn't know that it was so centrally located when I booked it (it was just cheap
and close to what looked like the centre).

Naturally, the church was the first thing that I went to go see on Saturday. The
guide of the walking tour recommended it because of the great views.
Inside, there were a variety
