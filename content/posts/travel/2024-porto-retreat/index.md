  This week, Beeper (which is now the Messaging division of Automattic) had our
  four-day 2024 Q2 work retreat in Porto, Portugal. These are my thoughts and
  reflections on the trip.

The past few weeks have been exciting for Beeper. We
[made Beeper available to everyone without a
waitlist](https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-now-available/),
[launched a new Android app based on our own internally-built Matrix SDK written
in Go](https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/how-beeper-android-works/), and
[were acquired by Automattic](https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-joining-automattic/)
for
[$125M](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/wordpress-com-owner-automattic-acquires-multi-service-messaging-app-beeper-for-125m/).
As part of the acquisition, we are merging the [Texts.com](http://texts.com/)
and Beeper products and under the Beeper brand. All of this is only a few months
on the heels of our
[Beeper Mini launch](https://blog.beeper.com/2023/12/05/introducing-beeper-mini-get-blue-bubbles-on-android-%f0%9f%92%99/)
which brought fully end-to-end encrypted iMessage to Android devices.

Like Beeper, Automattic is a
[remote-only company](https://automattic.com/about/) and so is the Texts.com
team, so work retreats are the only time that we can connect with our co-workers
in-person and build stronger personal relationships with among the team. This
retreat felt especially necessary because we are combining two teams together
and we wanted to build personal relationships across the previously separate
teams.

Our destination for this retreat was Porto, Portugal. We've had a [retreat in
Portugal before]({{< ref "/posts/travel/2022-lisbon-and-paris/ericeira-portugal"
>}}), but not in Porto. We also have had retreats in [Montreal]({{< ref
"/posts/travel/2021-dc-montreal/2021-09-13-17-montreal" >}}), [Playa del
Carmen]({{< ref "/posts/travel/2022-playa-del-carmen-mexico" >}}), [Mexico
City]({{< ref "/posts/travel/2022-mexico-city-retreat" >}}), [Amsterdam]({{< ref
"/posts/travel/2023-amsterdam-retreat/retreat" >}}), and most recently in
[Toronto]({{< ref "/posts/travel/2023-toronto-retreat" >}}) last fall.

I was running the [2024 Mines High School Programming Competition]({{< ref
"/posts/school/2024-hspc" >}}) on Saturday, so I had to leave on an evening
flight in order to arrive in Porto by Monday.

Unfortunately, the best flight I was able to get that left late enough on
Saturday went through Munich with a 7 hour layover before the flight to Porto.
(My returning flight goes through Frankfurt, so it's not much better either.
Automattic paid for an upgrade to Economy Plus with some extra leg room. On top
of that, the middle seat next to me was unoccupied! I slept for the majority of
the flight and got to Munich airport in a reasonable condition. Immigration was
easy, and then I found a bench to lay down on and took another nap. Then I
grabbed some dinner and then went to the
