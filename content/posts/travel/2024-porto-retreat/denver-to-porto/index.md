I'm making my way across the pond once again, this time for a work retreat. I'm
attending a [team meetup]({{< ref "../retreat/index.md" >}}) in Porto, Portugal.

I ran the [2024 Mines High School Programming Competition]({{< ref
"/posts/school/2024-hspc" >}}) on Saturday, and I had to be in Porto by Monday
morning. Thus, I had to leave on an evening flight on Saturday in order to
arrive in time. Unfortunately, the best flight I was able to get that left late
enough on Saturday went through Munich with a 7 hour layover before the flight
to Porto. My return flight goes through Frankfurt (it's kinda annoying having to
go out of the way to Germany to get to and from Portugal, but it is what it is).

Automattic paid for an upgrade to Economy Plus with some extra leg room. On top
of that, the middle seat next to me was unoccupied! I slept for the majority of
the flight and got to Munich airport in a reasonable condition. Immigration was
easy, and then I found a bench to lay down on and took another nap. Then I
grabbed some dinner and waited around for my 21h20 flight. It got delayed by
around 10 minutes, and then we had to de-ice in Munich before flying to Porto. I
was in an aisle seat for this leg and I slept most of that flight as well.

Upon my midnight arrival in Porto we had to take a bus to the terminal. However
once in the terminal, I was greeted by a driver with a fancy Beeper sign. I felt
very special. It was the first time I've been greeted with a cool sign by a
driver at an airport. The driver took me all the way from Francisco SÃ¡ Carneiro
Airport to the hotel where we are having our retreat
[Boeira Garden Hotel Porto Gaia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iV4TEZbwPHL2jhax6).
Check-in was easy, and I hit the sack immediately. I'm excited about what the
next few days of the meetup will hold!
