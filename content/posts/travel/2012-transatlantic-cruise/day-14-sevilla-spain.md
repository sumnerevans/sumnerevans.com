Today we started early, went to breakfast and then got out in Cadiz
(cad-ese; with an emphasis on the s), our port for the day. We had a
simi-private tour to Sevilla (seh-vil is the English pronunciation but
if you want to be more proper and use the Spanish version it goes like
seh-v-ee-yuh) today and it started in Cadiz. As we drove out of Cadiz
the guide, Francisco, talked over the intercom about the city. It is one
of the oldest cities in the world and was settled by the phonetians, the
Carthaginians, the Romans, the Visigoths (I think), the moors and now
the Spanish. Cadiz was the starting point for Columbus's journey to
discover the new world. It used to be an island and Sevilla was on the
coast of th sea. It has a long history of being a sea oriented city as
well as an aerospace center. It was an hour and fourty-five minutes
drive to Sevilla. I slept a good deal of the way. The countryside that I
did get to see was beutiful, nothing like anything at I have seen in the
States. Anyway when we got to Seville we drove down the main avenue and
saw all of the beautiful buildings. Then we stopped at one of the
squares in the city. American square I believe was the name. This park
was made for the world exhibition that was held in nineteen twenty-nine.
In this park was a nice fountain and a lot of pigeons. The pigeons were
a gift from someone, maybe the king of Spain or something like that. On
one side of the square was a renaissance style building made by
Seville's equivalent to Gaudi. There was also a moorish style building
on he opposite side. The next thing that we did is get back on the bus
and go to the old Jewish and Muslim quarters. The first quarter that we
went to was he Jewish quarter. This area was very nice with lots of
small streets and alleys with hole-in-a-wall shops and buildings that
were built in very tight spaces. We went all over going down streets and
through small squares. It was nice because the whole area is pedestrian
only. So we didn't have to worry about being run over by cars or
motorcycles like we did in Vietnam. We went to a palace called the
Alcazar. This palace was built b the moors (the Muslims in Spain) and
hen taken over by the Christians in the reconquest of Spain for
Christianity. Inside there was much moorish influence in the
architecture and in the decoration but in some places the Christians had
Christianized the buildings. One such place was a courtyard that was
moorish on the bottom but on the top they had put a renaissance style
floor. It didn't look good. It was really hot, 44 degrees centigrade,
112 degrees Fahrenheit and though it was really neat it was always just
where's the next shady spot! I need shade! Etc. After going to the
Alcazar we went to a square in between the Alcazar and the cathedral.
This square was called Plaza del Something I forgot the name of the
square but it had a statue of someone (descriptive, eh?). This was to be
our meeting place after a little free time in which we could go and do
whatever we wanted. We decided to go walking looking for an ice cream
place that we had seen. We didn't find it but we found a different ice
cream shop and we went inside. We used our Español (Spanish) to order
our ice cream. You should have seen us trying to communicate, there was
lots of pointing and attempts at using the other persons language. The
main language that we communicated in was Español though. We made our
way winding through the streets back to the square where we were
supposed to meet to go to the bus. Like I said it was 112 degrees
Fahrenheit (44 degrees centigrade) and some of the peoples tempers were
as hot as the weather. I will back up just a little and tell you that
there were two groups of people going on the tour with two tour guides.
One group had organized themselves through Cruise Critic and the other
didn't we don't know where they organized themselves. Regardless of
where they did, they obviously didn't get the memo that there was a lot
of walking involved. There was one person with a cane and another with a
walker in their group which held everything up for them. When we were
about a block from he bus the husband of the woman with the walker came
up to the guide and had a mild explosion "You have to slow down and wait
for the people who can't keep up!!! La de da de da..." anyway this went
on for a while because some other people got involved as well. One of
the people from our group said that he was going to go tell the guide
that we were going to walk to the bus by ourselves. That made the
caravan get moving. When we got on the bus it felt like a sauna it was
like a greenhouse! Some people were complaining about how hot it was and
it resounded like these seventy and sixty year old people had just
gotten out of preschool! On the way back I do not know if the complained
any more but I do know that the back of my eyelids are very black.

We Woke up at 7:30 and had an early breakfast this morning. We are now in Cadiz,
Spain and we had a little trouble getting OFF the boat, but made it! We did not
want to be late, so we  made sure we were early on the bus (just to let you
know, we booked a tour with  other people. But it is not through the boat) it
Ended up that these other people made us be 30-40 min late getting started. Had
a VERY long drive to Savilla. American Way'; Savilla (Suh-vill)Spanish Way;
Savilla (suh-vee-uh)I kind of dozed off in the van. Plus the drive was an hour
and a half to two hours.  When we got there we saw garden. Next we saw a pretty
cathedral. Next we went  to a square bought another postcard. When tour over at
2:45 we got to have some  free time until 4:00. (4:00 is when the van would pick
us up)During our free  time, we ate a bite of lunch, went to go look for a
dessert. We found a gelato  place. The gelato was REALLY good. we also got lost
trying to look for a bathroom, and to find our way back to the meeting spot, got
to practice my Spanish  when trying to ask for a bathroom, when the guide took
us to the bus, he said  it would not be a long way, I felt so bad for him
because all of the old-ish or  disabled-ish people were complaining and
basically being mean to him because he  said it would not be a long walk. (It
actually was around 5-7 blocks) When we  finally got in the bus, everyone was
hot and tired, the air-conditioning was as  high as it would go, but it still
was not very powerful. We thought we were  running late to get back to the boat,
so people were fussing, then a guy wanted  his beer bottle opened, so the bus
driver had to find a bottle opener.  Finally  we got on the road. After 30
minutes of so.  Made it with no problem at all. I  dozed off again. Our guides’
names were Francisco and Oscar. They were  brothers. Oscar is being trained by
Francisco.  After the tour, we went and had  dinner at the Lido. Tonight was a
special night apparently. It was called the  Spanish Fiesta. It was good. Did
you know they can make REALLY good rice? Anyhow,  I went straight from dinner to
Club HAL. It was pirate night. We first made  parrots, then we went to the kids’
room (kids meaning the 3-7 yr. olds) and  played a game of four corners. Four
corners is where music is played for about  20 sec. the caller closes their eyes
and everybody else runs to a corner. The  caller still has their eyes closed and
they call out a corner (1, 2, 3, 4 or a  name or letter) if someone is in that
corner they are out. But if no one is in  that corner, they have to start over.
If you are standing in the corner that  gets called, you are out. You play until
there is only one person, and that one  person is out. After four corners, we
went for our pirates’ treasure hunt. Oh,  I forgot, we also made pirate hats. I
had to leave at 9:00 so I did not get to  do the whole thing, but I did find a
paper flower. I then went to bed

Buenas Noche! (Bu-way-nahs No-chey! good night in Spanish
