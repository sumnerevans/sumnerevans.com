Today was my last day in Lisbon. I spent the morning on a walking tour of the
city and then flew to Paris.

# Touring Lisbon

The tour was gratuity based, and it was really good. The guide's name was Hugo
and he was very engaging and informative. He took us around a bunch of places in
Alfama, and he pointed out interesting things that I wouldn't have noticed on my
own.

## Avoiding the tourist traps

Hugo is a Lisbon native, and he spoke his mind about what he thought about
things. For example he railed against a particular attraction: the >>>>>>>>>TODO
elevator which he rightly described as a tourist trap. Every day, the line for
the elevator is constantly long. The elevator literally just takes you on a 30
second ride up to a view above the city for the small price of TODO>>>>>>>>>>>
EUR 5. He explained that it was a total rip-off, and even gave the tip that if
you really want to go on it for some reason, you can just get on at the top and
go down for free.

## Culture: Portugal's primary export

He led us up the hill on which Alfama is situated, around the old castle that I
went to a few days ago. On the way, we stopped at a mural commemorating Fado, a
music famous to Lisbon. He basically described it as sadboy Flamenco. He
explained that Portugal has not fared well economically over the years, and the
music somewhat reflects that. One quote that stuck with me was:

> People come to Lisbon for the gastronomy, not the economy.

While there are some other light industries such as cork production as well. The
primary industry in Portugal is tourism.

## Travelling the world in a day

When we arrived at one particular overlook, he pointed out the
TODO>>>>>>>>>>>>>> bridge that is very similar in style to the Golden Gate
Bridge and a statue of Jesus that is similar to the Jesus statue in Rio. He said
"and here we have a bridge that is normally in San Francisco, and a Jesus that
is normally in Rio" TODO>>>>>was there something else>>>>>>>>>>>>> and then
said: "you can visit all these sites in one day and take pictures and put them
on social media. Then you can say you went to San Francisco and Rio
TODO>>>>>>>>>>somewhere else?>>>>>>>>>> and because your friends are stupid,
they will think you went to all of those places!

## Learning some more history

Hugo explained that the first evidence of people living in the Lisbon area was
the Phonetians. The next major civilization to settle the area was the Romans
who named the area Lusitania. Ruins of structures they built still exist in some
places. The next major influence was the Moors who occupied much of the Iberian
peninsula during the NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNth to the NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNth
centuries. After the Christian reconquest, the Kingdom of Portugal was
established in 1143. From that point on, the borders of the country have not
changed, and in that way, Portugal has a claim to the title of oldest country in
Europe. After a revolution in the TODO>>>>>>>>>>> 1970's, Portugal became a
Republic and it has been since that point.

The 1754 earthquake + tsunami + fire destroyed most of the city hit many of the
Muslim and Jewish areas weee saved since they were not celebrating all saints
day

The earthquake was an example that the philosopher used to demonstrate that
bad things happen to everyone

## Other random facts

Lisbon is home to one of the first public urinals. There is one right outside of
the castle walls that is still available for use today.

Portugal and England have the honour of having the oldest alliance in the world.
They entered an alliance in TODO>>>>>>>>>>>>>YEAR AND WHAT FOR>>>>>>>>

They are famous for TODO>>>>>>>>>WHAT ARE THEY CALLED?>>>>>>>>> tiles which, if
crafted authentically, have insulating properties because they 
have an airgap between the outer and inner layers.
TODO>>>>>>>>>>>>>FACT CHECK>>>>>>>>>>>
For a long time, the tiles were sold as souvenirs, but now it is illegal to sell
them because of their rarity and historical significance.
TODO>>>>>>>>>>>>>END FACT CHECK>>>>>>>>>>>
There are many imitation tiles that just have pretty patterns but no actual
insulating properties, but there are very few authentic ones being created
today. TODO>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>OR NONE?>>>>>>>>>>>>>

There was a large campaign for dog adoption a few years ago, and many dog parks
and other resources were set up to help dog owners.
It was quite successful from a humane TODO>>>>>>>is that the right word?>>>>>>>
standpoint
TODO>>>>>>>>>>>how successful?>>>>>>>>>
Although there has been success on the animal TODO>>>>>rights, but not>>>>>>
front, there is still one major inhumane thing that exists in Portugal: bull
fighting. Since a few years ago, it is illegal to televise bull fights and Hugo
hopes that they will be illegal in a few years.

Hugo was a great guide, and I really enjoyed the tour. I recommend you take his
tour if you have the chance. He is on Instagram: TODO>>>>>>IG LINK>>>>>>

After the tour was over, Hugo gave some recommendations for restaurants in the
area.
TODO WHERE AND WHO WITH>>>>>>>>>>

-----------

After lunch, it was getting towards mid-afternoon, so I headed over to the
airport and went to the TODO>>>>>lounge_name>>>>>>>>> airport lounge for a while
to do some blog catchup. It was the first time I'd ever been in an airport
lounge. I recently got the CapitalOne Venture X card which has Priority Pass
lounge access, so I figured it would be fun to take advantage of it for a couple
hours.

My flight to Paris on TAP Air Portugal was in the evening and arrived fairly
late into Paris. On the approach to Orly (the airport outside of Paris) I was
able to see the Eiffel Tower out the window!

After disembarking, I took the train to Gare du Nord and went to my hostel: St.
Christopher's Inn. It was not nearly as nice as the one in Lisbon, but it was a
bed for the night.
