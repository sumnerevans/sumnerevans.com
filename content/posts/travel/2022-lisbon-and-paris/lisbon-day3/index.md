Monday woke up late then went to the beach in cascais
Stopped for lunch at a place and got seafood spaghetti.
Went paddle boarding and napped a lot in the sun

Then we went to a place that served muscles and had two buckets full plus some steak and salmon and tuna tartare
Then we took the train back.
(In morning we took an Uber van or something)

The buckets were with pesto and with garlic sauce.
Also had gin
