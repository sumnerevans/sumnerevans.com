Due to staying up way too late last night in Alfama, today was a day for
relaxing. I woke up just before noon, and a few people that I'd hung out with at
various points over the past few days (and who had also been out late last night
partying) were planning to go to a beach in Cascais, a town a bit west of
Lisbon.

There were seven of us in total: Ben (the guy I hung out with for most of the
time last night), Jaimes, Maggie, Sadie, Chewy, Kiara, and myself. We took an
Uber (or something like that) on our way to Cascais.

By that time some of us were hungry, and decided to get some food. I went with
Chewy (who is from Singapore), Sadie (from LA, I think), and Jaimes (who is from
the states somewhere I think) to a great seafood restaurant called [_Taberna
Clandestina Cascais_](https://g.page/tabernaclandestinacascais).

At that point, we headed over to the beach where the other three were lounging.
I got in the water for a few minutes, but it was pretty cold, so I ended up
napping most of the afternoon on the beach. Late in the afternoon, a few of us
decided to rent paddle boards to go around the harbour.

By the time we were done paddle boarding, it was mid-evening and so we decided
to get some dinner. I went with Jaimes, Chewy, and Ben (who is from somewhere in
the states) to a place called [_Moules &
Gin_](https://goo.gl/maps/7jjrpmFtYN2razNo7). Their speciality was _moules_,
Portuguese for mussels. We ordered two buckets of mussels: one in a pesto
broth/sauce, and the other one with garlic flavoured broth. We also ordered
salmon and tuna tartare and an order of steak and frites. And of course, we had
to have some gin as well to round out the meal. It was delicious, and it was
definitely the most mussels I'd ever eaten in one sitting.

After dinner, we took the train from Cascais back to Lisbon and I went to bed
because it was already quite late.
