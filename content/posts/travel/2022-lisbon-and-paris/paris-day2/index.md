Today, I took a day trip to the Normandy beaches. The tour visited Omaha Beach,
the American Cemetery at Omaha, and Juneau Beach. ============TODO

Instead of narrating exactly what we saw, I'm going to just give a few thoughts
about the emotions that I felt about the day.



It was quite a long bus ride
in the morning to get from Paris to Omaha Beach.

The same waters the same sand the same hills and the same fields

Very different circumstances. To liberate and to commemorate.

For many to die, that the west might live.
The tides come and go. The forces of creation are constant. The forces of men are fleeting.
The graves are arranged facing west
