Today, I went to the Alfama district and toured the Castelo de S達o Jorge. Then,
in the evening, I went out with some people from the hostel to the streets where
there were celebrations for the _Feast of Saint Anthony_ which is the largest
festival in Lisbon.

After a small breakfast at the hostel, I started walking over towards the
Castelo de S達o Jorge in the Alfama district which is the old quarter of Lisbon.
My goal was to eventually get to the castle, but I wanted to enjoy walking
through the old quarter on my way, so I went at a very leisurely pace.
The streets were beautiful, and in some areas, people were already setting up
decorations for the celebration that night.

The Castelo de S達o Jorge is situated on the top of a hill that has great views
of the city. Because of this, it has been a strategic stronghold for every
civilization that lived in the area. The area of the castle has Roman ruins and
evidence has been found of settlements as far back as the 8th century B.C. The
main castle on the site was built by the Moors during the Arab occupation
Additional structures were built after the Christian reconquest of the area when
the castle became a royal residence.

The castle grounds are home to a museum which contains many artefacts from the
various periods of settlement in the area.

        The views of the city from within the castle were stunning. I can see
        why it was chosen as a defensive outpost.

After spending a couple hours at museum and the castle, I wandered back through
Alfama towards the Se de Lisboa (Lisbon Cathedral). When I arrived, there was a
televised wedding going on. I looked it up, and apparently it is the *Wedding of
Saint Anthony* a collective wedding for a set of 16 couples that happens every
June 12th. In the past, poor couples were chosen for the wedding. Although,
today I am not sure if being low-income is one of the qualifying factors.

As I continued walking through Alfama, the streets were a bustle of activity as
people set up make-shift stands for selling beer, shots, and bar foods.

In the evening after dinner, there was a "parade" like the one in Bermuda

After that we went with a large group to find the street parties. We followed
one guy but the area we went to was way too crowded, so some of us broke off and
went to Alfama district which was great. We just wandered around and watched the
live bands and outdoor temporary beer stands

- Sagres, Super Bock seemed to have a competition
