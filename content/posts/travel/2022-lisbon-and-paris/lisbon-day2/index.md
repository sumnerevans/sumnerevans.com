Today, I went to the Alfama district and to the Castelo de São Jorge.

Went to Alfama district and saw the castle

Sunday after castle wandered streets to find the se de Lisboa
There was a wedding going on
It was televised.
I then wandered through the old town

Castle had Roman’s and then Arabs and then captured by the Christians

It was used as defensive for most of the time but was used as a palace as well

In the evening after dinner, there was a "parade" like the one in Bermuda

After that we went with a large group to find the street parties. We followed
one guy but the area we went to was way too crowded, so some of us broke off and
went to Alfama district which was great. We just wandered around and watched the
live bands and outdoor temporary beer stands

* Sagres, Super Bock seemed to have a competition
