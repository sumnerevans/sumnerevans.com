Today I had to leave the beautiful city of Berlin to head back home from the
Matrix Community Summit. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the city and at the
summit.

train to airport was fine

My connection was through Munich

Nobody in the middle seat on my flight from MUC -> DEN (D in 3-3-3)

It felt every bit of the ten hours

Global Entry is the best thing ever
