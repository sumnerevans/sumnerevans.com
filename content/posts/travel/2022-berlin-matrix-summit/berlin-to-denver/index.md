Today I had to leave the beautiful city of Berlin to head back home from the
Matrix Community Summit. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the city and at the
summit.

Getting to the airport via the train was uneventful and my quick flight to
Munich was fine as well. On the flight from Munich to Denver, the seat
configuration was a 3-3-3 in economy, and I was in D (outside of the middle
row). In a stroke of luck, the middle seat in the row was unoccupied, so I was
able to put my backpack under the middle seat and have more legroom.

Despite having done this exact same flight a couple weeks ago when [coming back
from Lisbon]({{< ref "../../2022-lisbon-and-paris/london-back-home" >}}), this
flight felt much longer. It felt every bit like a ten hour flight.

Getting through customs was a breeze because I have Global Entry. It is so
convenient to be able to skip all of the customs and immigration queues. And, it
makes me feel superior to the other lowly travellers who have to wait in the
long lines ðŸ˜‚

I'm going to look back fondly on my trip to Berlin, and I hope that I will see
many of the people at the summit at another event in the future.
