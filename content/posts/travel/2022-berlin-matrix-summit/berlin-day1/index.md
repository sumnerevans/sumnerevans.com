Today I did some sightseeing in the morning and then I did some work during the
afternoon and into the evening. I'm still trying to put in mostly full days at
work while I'm here in Germany until the Summit starts.

I took the S-Bahn over to the Berlin TV Tower which is just a couple stops away
from my hotel. The tower is the tallest structure in Germany, and was built by
the Soviets.

Went to the TV Tower

- Lots of stuff about Jews
- Lots of stuff about East / West divide

Went to get a currywurst

worked the afternoon/evening

went to a restaurant and got steak and fries
