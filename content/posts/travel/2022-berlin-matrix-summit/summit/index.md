The main purpose of my trip this week was for the Berlin Matrix Community
Summit, an event organized by members of the Matrix community in Berlin. Matrix
is the chat protocol that Beeper (the company I work for) is building our chat
app on top of. The protocol is developed openly, and has a large community of
open source developers, projects, and businesses all building on top of Matrix.
This summit was the first Matrix-only event. There have been other events at
which Matrix had a large presence such as FOSDEM, but this was the first
ever Matrix-only event.

The people attending the event had quite diverse reasons for attending. Some,
like myself, work full time at companies building on top of Matrix. Others were
system administrators at various institutions that are running Matrix servers
for their chat platforms. Still others were enthusiasts building projects with
Matrix or wanting to learn more about the ecosystem. In total, at least
fifty-seven people were in attendance!

The summit was held at c-base, an open-source-focused hackerspace in the heart
of Berlin. There were three rooms for talks and workshops, and a packed schedule
with three tracks throughout most of Friday and Saturday. There was also space
outside by the River TODO>>>>>>>>>>>>>RIVERNAME>>>>>>>> with tables to hang out
at.

# Barcamp

On Thursday we had a [barcamp](TODO>>>>>>>>>>>>URL TO BARCAMP) which comprised
of a meet-and-greet and introductions followed by creating a small schedule of
discussions on some of the topics where there was mutual interest. At the
discussions I attended, we talked about bridges, server load testing, various
clients, and the Matrix specification.

In my opinion, the most interesting thing about the discussions was getting to
know some of the conference participants and learn from their expertise and also
their questions. The experience that everyone brought was quite diverse: Nadine
is a UX designer, Nico is developing a native TODO>>>>>>>>>what is it written
in?>>>>>>>> Matrix client called Nheko, Jan is a network administrator of a
Matrix deployment at TODO>>>>>>>>>where?>>>>>>>>>, Christian works on bridges at
Element, I work on Bridges at Beeper, Aiman just started working at a company
that is building tools for bridging chats across multiple chat networks through
Matrix, TODO>>>>>>>>>>>SPELLING WITH ACCENT?>>>>>>>>>Jose works at a company
building tools for businesses to bridge customer support chats into Matrix, Kim
develops bots and runs a homeserver for a couple dozen users, NetworkException
TODO>>>>>>>what do they do?>>>>>>>>>, Henri and Charles are working on two
unrelated social media platforms built on top of Matrix, and that was just a
some of the participants in the barcamp which itself a small subset of all the
conference attendees.

At the end of the day, we had a barbecue sponsored by Beeper with steaks,
bratwursts, grilled vegetables, and cheeses along with some break and lots of
different sauces. Yan and Nadine were the main ones in charge of the conference
food, but as the only Beeper employee in attendance, I did my best to help. They
had thought of pretty much everything, though, so my role was mainly to take
credit for securing funding for the food :)

# Talks and Workshops

On Friday and Saturday, there was a full schedule of TODO>>>>>>how many?>>>>>>>
talks and workshops hosted by TODO>>>>>>>>>check number>>>>>>>> eighteen
different people. During most of the conference, there were three tracks going
at once. There were so many that I was not able to attend all of the ones I
wanted to attend! I'll give a few highlights of talks and workshops that I
enjoyed.

  As one of the first workshops of the summit, Valentin facilitated a time for
  people to discuss their homeserver configurations.

# Presentation Time!

In addition to attending many talks and workshops, I gave a few as as well. On
Friday, I gave a [presentation about Hungryserv]({{< ref
"/portfolio#presentation-hungryserv" >}}), a project that we are pursuing at
Beeper to help us scale to more users. I was happy that so many people were
interested in the project, and the attendees had many great questions.

# Conclusion

I think the Matrix ecosystem has a bright future ahead of it. I feel like all of
us in the community are at the start of something big. There are so many smart,
energized people working on Matrix, and I feel fortunate to have been able to
get to know a few of them at the summit.

I think that history will look at many of the people in attendance at the summit
as pioneers of their respective niches in the Matrix ecosystem. The great thing
about the Matrix ecosystem is that it's not dependent on a single entity; there
is no single point of failure.

The future of Matrix is bright: now we just have to go build it!
