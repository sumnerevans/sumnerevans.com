  I'm once again headed across the pond! This time it is for the first ever
  Berlin Matrix Community Summit.

This week, I am heading to Berlin for the week for the Berlin Matrix Community
Summit! The event will happen on Thursday through Saturday, but I am heading
there early so that I can work and have a bit of vacation before the summit.

I flew out on Saturday late afternoon on Lufthansa. There seem to be no direct
flights to Berlin, so I flew through Frankfurt on the way out (and will fly via
Munich on the way back).

Both flights were rather uneventful, though there was some turbulence. Maybe
it's just a German airline thing, but they didn't turn on the fasten seatbelt
light even when it was quite bumpy.

A from Germany guy that is attending the conference that I've been in contact
with told me about a TODO>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>EUR9 transit ticket that allows access
to almost all public transit within Germany for the month of August. It was
fortunate that he told me about it, because it was not obvious how to buy it at
the ticket machine, but I found it and got on the TODO>>>>>>>>(SPELLING)>>>>>>S Bahn 
to TODO>>>>>>>>(SPELLING)>>>>>>Janovitzbruke. My hotel was only a couple hundred
meters away from the station.

By the time I got to Berlin, I was quite tired, but it was too early to go to
bed so I tried to stay awake by going to get some dinner and wander around. I
still ended up going to sleep very early, but at a reasonable-enough time that
I'll be able to get on a decent sleep schedule tomorrow.
