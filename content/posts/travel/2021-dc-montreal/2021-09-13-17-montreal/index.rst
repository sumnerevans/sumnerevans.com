As I mentioned in my `previous post <../2021-09-10-denver-to-dc>`_, the main
reason for my travel was for a work retreat with Beeper in Montreal. The purpose
of the retreat was for all of us to get to work together in person. For most of
us (myself included), it was the first time meeting anyone else on the team in
person. In fact, the closest person to me in the company lives in Provo Utah.

Instead of relating to you what we did every

On Tuesday, we went on

* walking tour on Tuesday

  * nuns who built warehouse to fund hospital
  * woman who got promoted to cofounder
  * constant tension between French and English, seen in architecture

* work meetings

  * kickoff + retro
  * discussions about things
  * weekly pruning + move to Linear
  * lightning talks

* reflections

  * we have come a long way
  * we are so far away from being done
  * we have big goals, but we have a super young and energetic team to get it
    done
  * I trust my team: they are amazing people and super smart
  * I like the feeling of being the dumbest person in the room
  * You have to oscillate between feeling incompetent and feeling like a
    rockstar super quickly

* dinners

  * Terrase William Gray - bougie, had bird
  * poutine
  * ramen + ice cream
  * hella fancy place
  * noodles
