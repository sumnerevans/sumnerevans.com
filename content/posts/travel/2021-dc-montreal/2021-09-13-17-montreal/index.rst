As I mentioned in my `previous post <../2021-09-10-denver-to-dc>`_, the main
reason for my travel was for a work retreat with Beeper in Montreal. The purpose
of the retreat was for all of us to get to work together in person. For most of
us (myself included), it was the first time meeting anyone else on the team in
person. In fact, the closest person to me in the company lives in Provo Utah.

Instead of relating to you what we did every chronologically, I'm going to give
you some highlights and overall thoughts on the week.

Working With My Coworkers
=========================

Meeting my coworkers in person was the best part of the trip. We are an
all-remote company, so these retreats are the only times we have to work
in-person. I really enjoyed getting to meet everyone and interact with them in
both work and non-work situations. We had somewhat normal work days every day,
but we took advantage of our physical proximity to have more vision, planning,
and retrospective meetings. We went out to eat in the evenings and on a few
days, we had extra evening activities.

I think one of the best parts of the whole experience was that I was able to get
to know people who are not on my direct team. For example, one evening, I sat at
a table with Caroline, the Chief of Staff; Scott, who is on my bridge team;
Alex, an Android developer; Ian, an iOS developer; and Annie, a React desktop
app developer. I really enjoyed all of my interactions with my coworkers, and I
gained a great deal of confidence in their competence and our ability to
collectively get the necessary work done.

Our whole-company meetings were really great as well. Brad (CTO) led a company
retrospective for the past few months 

Walking Tour
