I woke up this morning around 08:30 with the plan to meet up with Sam, Jo, and
Robby at the Air and Space Museum when it opened at 10:00. However, since Robby
had gotten in so late, and had flown into Dulles (which is a long way away from
DC), they were pretty slow getting up this morning.

I decided to go over alone and start looking at the exhibits. I always love
seeing rockets and planes. Unfortunately, probably about 70% of the museum is
closed for renovation. I went through the first few exhibits with a myriad of
spacecraft including a moon lander. I am always so amazed when I see how
primitive the technology was during the space race. And yet we landed on the
moon.
