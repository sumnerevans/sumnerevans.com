I woke up this morning around 08:30 with the plan to meet up with Sam, Jo, and
Robby at the Air and Space Museum when it opened at 10:00. However, since Robby
had gotten in so late, and had flown into Dulles (which is a long way away from
DC), they were pretty slow getting up this morning.

I decided to go over alone and start looking at the exhibits. I always love
seeing rockets and planes. Unfortunately, probably about 70% of the museum is
closed for renovation. I went through the first few exhibits with a myriad of
spacecraft including a moon lander. I am always so amazed when I see how
primitive the technology was during the space race. And yet we landed on the
moon.

One of the open exhibits was one about navigation and its relationship to time.
The exhibit started with showing sea navigation clocks mounted on gimbals that
seamen used for navigation. In order to calculate position on the globe,
accurately kept time is required to determine longitude. Navigating
in-atmosphere causes additional problems due to speed and turbulence, so many
systems were devised to help airplanes navigate the skies. One that I really
like is the radio signal beacons that airports used to help guide planes in.
They emitted different Morse code signals at different angles such that when you
were off on your approach in one direction, it gives one Morse code letter and
if you go off in the other direction, it gives you a different letter. If you
are on track, those two letters combine to create a single constant sound. In
this way, unskilled pilots can navigate to their destination much easier than
before.

Before GPS, many different systems were deployed by various branches of the
military to help in navigation. GPS unified them all. One of the biggest
challenges of GPS is keeping consistent, synchronized time across the fleet of
GPS satellites. This requires the precision of atomic clocks. Interestingly, due
to General Relativity and the gravitational pull of the Earth, GPS satellites'
clocks have to be adjusted by a few millionths of a second every day.

By the time I'd made one pass through that exhibit, Sam, Jo, and Robby arrived.
