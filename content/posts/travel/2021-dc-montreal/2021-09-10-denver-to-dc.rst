Next week, Beeper is having a company retreat in Montreal, Canada. Since I
haven't really done any sort of leisure travel that requires air travel since
the pandemic began, I decided to tack on a weekend getaway to the east coast. I
decided to meet up with a few fellow Mines graduates to hang out in DC for the
weekend.

Today I flew out of Denver to Washington D.C., and I'll be flying to Montreal on
Sunday. My roommate kindly took me to the airport at around 05:00 this morning.
I have Global Entry, so I got TSA Pre which made security a breeze. It took me
15 minutes from arriving at the airport to get through security! And that was
despite having to walk across the airport because only south security had a TSA
Pre line (I went in the north side of the airport).

Currently, I'm on the plane, and the captain just announced that we are starting
our approach into DCA. The plane is not full; lots of aisles with only one or
two people on them. I am in the window seat, and there's nobody in the middle
seat next to me which is great. I was able to put my backpack there for most of
the flight for more leg room. (It's the little luxuries that count on a plane
these days...)

I didn't check any bags, so I should be able to get out of the airport and to my
hotel pretty quickly, and then have the rest of the afternoon to sightsee.

After landing, I figured out how to get into D.C. via the Metro. Finding how to
get to the metro station from the airport was quite an adventure. It is not
obvious where you have to go to get to the platform, even though the platform is
in sight of the terminal. I ended up finding the path through what seemed to be
an under-construction part of the airport.

I made it to Union Station, and met up with Sam Sartor who came up to D.C. from
College of William and Mary where he is getting a PhD in computer science.

After leaving our bags at my hotel, we walked down towards the mall and went to
the museum of natural history for a few hours. We spent a while looking at a
whole lot of gems in the geology part of the museum. It was an impressive
collection. In
