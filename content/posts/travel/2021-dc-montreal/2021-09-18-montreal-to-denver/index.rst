This morning, I woke up at around 04:30 in order to head to the airport. Ian is
on the same flight to Denver as I am (he then continues on to Salt Lake City),
and Caroline's flight leaves at about the same time as our flight, so we all got
an Uber together.

* woke up hella early (04:30)
* got to airport at ~5:30 and got through security
* customs wasn't even opened yet

  * Global entry was nice
    fancy ass face recognition

* waited and talked at the gate for a while
* on plane going over great lakes right now
* get home and going to go straight to Mines and then to Master Black's
