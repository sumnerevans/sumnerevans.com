This morning, I woke up at around 04:30 in order to head to the airport. Ian is
on the same flight to Denver as I am (he then continues on to Salt Lake City),
and Caroline's flight leaves at about the same time as our flight, so we all got
an Uber together.

We got to the airport around 5:30, and going through security was really quick.
In many places (including Montreal) you go through US Customs before departing.
It's kinda a strange system, but it's nice because you can walk out of the plane
at your destination in the states and don't have to worry about customs. When we
got to customs, it wasn't even opened yet. I guess we could have had another few
minutes of sleep!

Because I have Global Entry, I was able to go to the short line. The kiosks for
Global Entry made it scarily easy to get my documentation. All I had to do was
look in the camera and get a picture and it did facial recognition on it and
printed out a piece of paper that I gave to the customs agent. If customs was
opened when I arrived, the whole process would have taken maybe five minutes
(when accounting for the short line after using the kiosk).

We all got to the gate and it was still a couple hours before our flight. We
kinda regretted not sleeping more, but I took the opportunity to get some
writing done and chat.

I slept for an hour or so on the plane, and then got some more writing done. We
flew right over the Great Lakes, and so I got to see Lake Michigan from the air
which was kinda cool. Once I got home, I headed over to Mines for a meeting
about next years high school programming competition (I've written extensively
about the [last]({{<ref"../../../school/2019-hspc.rst">}})
[three]({{<ref"../../../school/2020-hspc.rst">}})
[competitions]({{<ref"../../../school/2021-hspc.rst">}}) on this blog). Then I
went over to my taekwondo instructor's house for the annual school BBQ. Tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can relax a bit before diving into next week.
