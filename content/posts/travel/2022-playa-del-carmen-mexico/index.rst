This week, my company had our 2022 Q1 work retreat in Playa del Carmen, Mexico
(about an hour south of Cancun). As with the `previous work trip
<../2021-dc-montreal/2021-09-13-17-montreal>`_, the purpose of the retreat was
for us to get to work together in person and to bond as a team. I got to see
most of the people who were in Montreal again, and got to meet some of the new
team members who have joined the company since September.

Seventeen team-members were able to attend this retreat. We rented two Airbnb's
for the team and we spent our days at the larger of the two. Because we were all
basically in the same house for a week, it had a more communal feel than
Montreal and I felt like we were really able to get to know each other as a
team.

Doing Some Work, Squashing Some Bugs
====================================

My primary goal this week was to pair with `Finn
<https://gitlab.com/thefinn93>`_ on some tasks related to our Signal bridge.
Finn is a new teammate who joined a couple months ago. He is the author of
signald and we hired him partially so that we could have in-house expertise on
signald and Signal. Our goal was to migrate `signald
<https://gitlab.com/signald/signald>`_ to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite. The
reason for this is that it is significantly easier to optimize the performance
of Postgres databases (there are lots of settings that you can change) than
SQLite databases (which are quite difficult to optimize since they are
essentially disk-speed constrained). It was very nice to have Finn to bounce
questions and ideas off of while we worked on the migration. By the end of the
week, we'd proven that the migration would not only be viable, but would produce
actual noticeable improvements to the Signal bridge performance.

We're Going to Need a Bigger Boat
=================================

On Thursday, we went on a boat tour from Cancun to the Isla Mujeres. We had a
bus take us from the Airbnb to the

  I'm so glad I joined Beeper. Not because of this boat trip, but because these
  people are f***ing awesome!
