I attended NixCon and SCaLE in Pasadena, California for the first time this
year. I went with my friend [Addison](https://tgrcode.com), and while I was
there I also met up with some other friends, and made some new friends as well!

I flew out very early on Thursday morning from Denver to LAX. It was raining on
the way out of Denver, and the approach into LAX was quite windy. It was the
most turbulent flight I've been on in a very long time. Getting from LAX to
Pasadena was quite a journey. I had to take the Metro Connector from LAX over to
the Metro and then I took two metro lines up to Pasadena. It probably took an
hour and a half just on the metro to get there.

I arrived at the convention centre about an hour after the planned start time of
the first NixCon talk, however due to technical difficulties with the projector,
the conference hadn't actually started by the time I arrived. The first talk was
an introduction to Nix workshop. It was generally all things that I was aware
of, but it was cool to see so many people interested in Nix! The next talk was
on [Nix Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/). I'm a
maintainer of the project, so I also know how it works. The presenter did a good
job of explaining it, and showing people the benefits of using a declarative
system for defining your home environment. I think that at a future NixCon, I
want to actually give a talk about it. I didn't want to give a talk at this one
as it was my first time at a conference that wasn't free (like FOSDEM) and I
didn't know what level of quality was expected. I think that I am capable of
making a talk of the necessary quality for NixCon in the future, and I hope that
I'll have the opportunity to present in the future.

In the intermission between the talks, I went to the restroom and when I came
out, I ran into [Josh Hoffer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-hoffer/) who I
went to Mines with! I didn't expect to see him there, but it turns out his work
is heavily centred around NixOS. He introduced me to his coworker
[John Rinehart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrichardrinehart/) and we caught
up on what we have been up to since Mines.

After the Home Manager talk, I went to lunch and ended up at a taco place. I ran
into one of the presenters of the first talk (the introduction to Nix) and of
the talk that was coming up next about the Nix Module system. I met a few other
young professionals who were at the conference while in line waiting for my
tacos. [Nicolas (Nic)](https://nicfv.com/) works at
[NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/) at the Berkeley National Laboratory, and
[Nathan](https://www.nathanieljwright.com/) and Tony work on database software
at [AVEVA](https://www.aveva.com). There were a couple other people in the
group, but I didn't get to know them as well during the conference.

After lunch, Nic and I went back to the Nix room for the talk about Nix Modules.
