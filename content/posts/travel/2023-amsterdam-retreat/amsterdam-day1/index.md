Today I went to visit the Van Gogh museum in the morning, and the Anne Frank
House late in the evening.

* went to Van Gogh museum
* got coat
* wandered through park
* pizza lunch
* went to hotel and checked in, relaxed
* met with Brad, Scott, Bradley for fish dinner
* Anne Frank House

  * what struck me was the hope of liberation after the D-Day landings
