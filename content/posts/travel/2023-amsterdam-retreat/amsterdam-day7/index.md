  My last day in Amsterdam before I headed back home. I wandered around the
  beautiful streets of Amsterdam and had a nice lunch.

I woke up late on my last day in Amsterdam, and missed breakfast at the hotel.
After saying goodbye to the remaining coworkers at the hotel for the retreat, I
went to drop off my bag at the hotel where I am staying for one night before
heading back home.

I then headed back into Amsterdam city and walked around the streets admiring
the beauty of the city. I stopped for lunch at a restaurant and had some very
nice pizza. I was planning on renting a bike, but it was drizzling on and off so
I opted against it; walking in the rain was enough for me.

Here are a few photos of the streets and canals as I walked.
