  I made a whirlwind trip over to Berlin this past week for the Matrix
  Conference. I had the pleasure of presenting about Matrix Cryptographic Key
  Infrastructure at the conference, and I enjoyed listening to many other
  presentations.

My flight from Denver left Tuesday evening and arrived in Berlin late afternoon
on Wednesday. It was actually quite a nice schedule as I was able to sleep most
of the long leg to Munich which was close to my normal sleep-time anyway.
Getting to the hotel was an adventure. I took the FER?????????? and then the M43
bus. But the M43 bus failed to come at the scheduled time multiple times in a
row. Eventually it did, but I didn't make it to the hotel until well into the
evening. I met up with Tulir and Tobias, my other coworkers who are here at the
conference and they joined me as I went to get food (they'd eaten already).
After that, we turned in for the night.

Thursday was the start of the conference and a
[barcamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp) which comprised of a
meet-and-greet and introductions followed by creating a schedule of discussions
on some of the topics where there was mutual interest.
