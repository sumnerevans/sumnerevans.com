This week, I went to Oakland to visit a friend Jack Garner, a friend from school
who works at Salesforce out in San Francisco. I flew in in the evening on
Tuesday to minimize the time I had to take off of work. I worked for the first
two days and then we both took Friday and Monday off for a long weekend.

# Working from California

On Wednesday, we both worked from his apartment. That is the nice thing
about having a remote job in software engineering: you can work anywhere that
has Wi-Fi. In the evening, we went to a trendy food court. I had a nice bowl of
ramen.

On Thursday, I took my standup meeting from his apartment, and then we took the
train into San Francisco to work from Salesforce Tower for the rest of the day.
Jack gave me a tour of the Salesforce-occupied floors of the tower including the
top floor which would have had great views except for the complete fog cover. We
could barely even see the ground around the building! There is an elevated urban
park above the transit system and which connects a few office buildings near the
Salesforce Tower. We took a walk around that and then I headed to the WeWork at
the tower and he headed to the Salesforce floors for the rest of the day.

At lunch, we met up to go to a Vietnamese place. Another Mines student, Brooks,
who just started at Salesforce, joined us. Both Brooks and Jack were students in
the [Architecture class I taught]({{< ref "/portfolio#experience-adjunct-mines"
>}}) a couple semesters ago, so it was a fun reunion.

# Golden Gate Park

As I mentioned, we both took Friday and Monday off of work to have a long
weekend, and spent the weekend sightseeing.

On Friday we went to Golden Gate Park, which is a large park on the west side of
San Francisco similar to Central Park in New York, but bigger. There are walking
paths and some roads through the park, and there are various ecological,
cultural, and educational sites scattered around as well.

There is an art museum and a science museum, but we skipped those as they are a
bit expensive, and I wanted to do more active and outdoors stuff (and man did we
do _a lot_ of walking). One of the things in the park is a botanical garden. We
went there and walked around the entire thing. I was amazed by the biodiversity
that they were able to cultivate.
TODO>>>>>>>>>>>>>c MORE ABOUT THE GARDENS

By the time we were done wandering at the gardens, it was well into the
afternoon and, getting food was the most pressing concern.
We found a burrito restaurant TODO>>>>>>>>>> NAME
The burritos were quite good. One unique thing they did was slightly toast the
tortilla so it was crispy rather than soft on the outside.

TODO>>>>>>>>>>> waterfall with green water

After lunch, we continued walking to see the small bison herd that is kept
within the park. Apparently, the Bison were brought during the 19th century and 
a small herd has lived there ever since. It was quite surreal seeing Bison in
the middle of a coastal Californian city.

By that time, we were quite tired from walking around so we headed back for the
day.
