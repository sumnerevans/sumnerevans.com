  I'm going to FOSDEM!
---

I'm excited to announce that I'll be travelling to Brussels at the end of the
month to attend [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2023/), one of the largest open
source conferences in the world!

I arrive on 1 February, and I fly back on the 6th. My flight is being funded by
Beeper, and I'll be attending the [Matrix Community Meetup at
HSBXL](https://hsbxl.be/events/byteweek/2023/matrix-community-meetup/)
and then the conference itself.

I'm especially excited about the following devrooms:

* **Matrix** - since I'm working at a company that is building a product in the
  Matrix ecosystem.
* **Go** - since I use it extensively at work, and I've become a fan of the
  language overall.
* **Nix and NixOS** - since I use it on all of my personal server infrastructure
  and PCs.

If you'll be at FOSDEM and want to meet up, come to the Matrix Community Meetup
on Friday or find me hanging out around one of the dev rooms. You can also
[contact me]({{< ref "../../../../contact.md" >}}) if you want to meet.

I'm going to be doing some sightseeing on Wednesday and Thursday, and I'll write
about that here, too.
