TODO: LINKS TO PERSONAL SITES

For the first time since 2020, FOSDEM was held in-person in Brussels. FOSDEM is
one of the largest gatherings of open source enthusiasts in the world every
year. My employer, [Beeper](https://beeper.com) funded my flight, and I decided
to attend. It was a great experience!

The conference was Saturday and Sunday, but there was also a Matrix Community
Meetup on Friday that I attended. I was able to reconnect with many of the
people who I'd met at the
[Matrix Community Summit in Berlin last year]({{< ref "../../2022-berlin-matrix-summit/summit" >}})
and meet a bunch new people as well.

## The Matrix Community Meetup

HSBXL is a hackerspace in a nearly-abandoned building in a very convenient
location in the heart of Brussels. They were gracious enough to host the Matrix
community's meetup on Friday. [Yan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yncyrydybyl/)
(who was one of the organizers of the Berlin summit) and
[Kim](https://github.com/harharlinks) (who attended the Berlin
summit) did a great job organizing the meetup.
[Famedy](https://www.famedly.com/) and [Nordeck](https://nordeck.net/)
graciously funded pizza and drinks for the event.

The meetup was a great success. By the time I arrived at HSBXL a few minutes
after 13:00, there were already a couple dozen people there, and throughout the
afternoon the number of people in attendance at least doubled if not tripled.

The meeting was organized as a barcamp, but I think that most of the discussion
groups ended up morphing into topics other than the one intended and/or other
adhoc discussions began.

The most valuable part of the barcamp-style is the introductions round at the
beginning where everyone in attendance quickly introduced themselves and
mentioned who they were, why they were interested in Matrix, and what they were
interested in discussing. I was excited to put faces on many of the MXIDs that I
interact with online.

One of the discussions that I took part in was about [sliding
sync](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575) which is a
proposal for a new way to sync data from Matrix servers to Matrix clients.
[Kegan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kegan-dougal-218b3830/) is the main
architect behind the proposal and he answered many questions about the proposal
and we had interesting discussions about some of the benefits and limitations of
the proposal.

Throughout the afternoon and evening I got into a variety of conversations with
various great people. I was especially happy to get to meet
[Marcel](https://github.com/mtrnord), [Timo](https://github.com/timokoesters),
[Andrew](https://github.com/anoadragon453), and
[Ben](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benparsons/) in-person because they are very
active in the community and I'd only ever interacted with them online. I was
also happy to reconnect with [Nico](https://neko.dev/), Kim, Yan,
[Christian](https://chrpaul.de/), [networkException](https://nwex.de/), Shine,
Dominik, Phillip, Jannik, and others who I'd met at the Berlin summit.

After the event was over, a group of us headed out for burgers.

## It's Go Time!

TODO getting to FOSDEM was crazy on the tram

On Saturday, I spent most of my time in the Go dev room. 

## Entering the Matrix

took a different bus that was less crowded
