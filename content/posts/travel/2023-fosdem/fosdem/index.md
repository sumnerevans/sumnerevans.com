  I attended FOSDEM for the first time this year and I had a blast!
  I enjoyed attending many talks, but the best part was getting to meet so many
  cool people.

TODO: LINKS TO PERSONAL SITES

For the first time since 2020, ==========TODO VERIFY=========== FOSDEM 
was held in-person in Brussels. FOSDEM is one of the largest gatherings of open
source enthusiasts in the world every year.
My employer, [Beeper](https://beeper.com) funded my flight, and I decided to
attend. It was a great experience!

The conference was Saturday and Sunday, but there was also a Matrix Community
Meetup on Friday that I attended.
I was able to reconnect with many of the people who I'd met at the 
[Matrix Community Summit in Berlin last year]({{< ref "../../2022-berlin-matrix-summit/summit" >}})
and meet a bunch other people as well.

## The Matrix Community Meetup

HSBXL is a hackerspace in a nearly-abandoned building in a very convenient
location in the heart of Brussels. They were gracious enough to host the
Matrix community's meetup on Friday.
[Yan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yncyrydybyl/) (who was one of the organizers
of the Berlin summit) and
[Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-sebastian-brose/) (who attended the Berlin
summit)
=====TODO ANYONE ELSE AND VERIFY LINKS======
did a great job organizing the meetup.
[TODO](TODO URL) and [TODO](TODO: URL) graciously funded drinks and some pizza
for the event.

The meetup was a great success. By the time I arrived at HSBXL a few minutes
after 13:00, there were already a couple dozen people there, and throughout the
afternoon the number of people in attendance at least doubled.

The meeting was organized as a barcamp, but I think that most of the discussion
groups ended up morphing into topics other than the one intended and/or other
adhoc discussions began.

The most valuable part of the barcamp-style is the introductions round at the
beginning where everyone in attendance quickly introduced themselves and
mentioned who they were, why they were interested in Matrix, and what they were
interested in discussing. I was excited to put faces on many of the MXIDs that I
interact with online.

One of the discussions that I took part in was about [sliding sync](TODO LINK TO MSC)
which is a proposal for a new way to sync data from Matrix servers to Matrix
clients.
[Kegan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kegan-dougal-218b3830/) =======TODO VERIFY LINK
is the main architect behind the proposal and he answered many questions about
the proposal and we had interesting discussions about some of the limitations of
the existing proposal.

Throughout the afternoon and evening I got into a variety of conversations with
various great people. I was especially happy to get to meet
[Marcel](https://github.com/mtrnord), [Timo](https://github.com/timokoesters),
[Andrew](https://github.com/anoadragon453), and [Ben](TODO: URL) in-person
because they are very active in the community and I'd only ever interacted with
them online. I was also happy to reconnect with
[Nico](TODO: URL), [Kim](TODO: URL), [Yan](TODO: URL), [Christian](TODO: URL)
[networkException](https://github.com/networkException), [Shine](TODO: URL)
[Dominik](TODO: URL), [Phillip](TODO: URL), [Jannik](TODO: URL), and others who
I'd met at the Berlin summit.

After the event was over, a group of us headed out for burgers.

TODO: mention the sewed on Nheko patch to Nico

TODO: ask Kegan if there is a way to send back all events since (and including)
the last m.room.message/m.room.encrypted event in sync v3?

## It's Go Time!

TODO getting to FOSDEM was crazy on the tram

On Saturday, I spent most of my time in the Go dev room. 

## Entering the Matrix

took a different bus that was less crowded
