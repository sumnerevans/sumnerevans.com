I was recently asked to give the keynote address at the BlasterHacks hackathon
hosted at Mines. I wasn't quite sure what would be interesting to talk about for
the keynote, so I asked some friends. [Byron](https://b-sharman.dev/) suggested
that I either talk about hackathon advice or career advice. Since I was giving a
hackathon keynote, I decided to focus my presentation on hackathon advice. I
went to six hackathons while I was a student at Mines, and won prizes at all but
one of them so I felt I had something interesting to say about the topic.

I came up with the following seven things that I thought would make the
students' time at the hackathon worthwhile:

1. Focus on the Customer
2. Solve Problems That Actually Exist
3. Build Core Features First
4. Don't Prematurely Optimize
5. Learn Something New
6. Support Your Teammates
7. Have Fun

As I wrote down these seven items, I realized that actually, these are things
that you should do, and work on improving for your entire career. Proficiency in
these things are a big part of what differentiates senior engineers from junior
engineers.

During the hackathon keynote, I focused on how to apply these seven things in a
hackathon context, but in this article, I'm going to focus on how they apply to
your career more broadly.

## 1. Focus on the Customer

Every software project has a customer. It might just be you. It might be
millions of end-users who download your app. It might be a niche set of small
business owners. It might be local governments (as is the case at my
[current job]({{<ref"../../portfolio/index.html#experience-canam-tech-lead">}})).
It might be another team within your organization.

Whoever your customer is, let them guide you. Whenever you aren't sure how to
proceed, figure out what the customer wants. Ideally, you would do this by
directly talking to the customer, but sometimes this is not possible and you
just have to put yourself into their shoes. In the hackathon context, it is very
unlikely that you will be able to talk with your customer, but you need to have
a good idea of their needs in order to build something for them.



Explain who your customer is
Talk about how your project solves the customerâ€™s problem



## 2. Solve Problems That Actually Exist
## 3. Build Core Features First
## 4. Don't Prematurely Optimize
## 5. Learn Something New
## 6. Support Your Teammates
## 7. Have Fun

Things I've learned as a tech lead:

* you have two bosses, your manager, and your direct reports
* administrative and managerial tasks are actually your job now, not just distractions from your job
