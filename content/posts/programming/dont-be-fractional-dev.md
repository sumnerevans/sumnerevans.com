Everyone wants to be a 10x developer, but we rarely talk about the opposite of a
10x developer: a fractional developer.

First, let me define what I mean when I say a *Y*x developer. _Y_ is a
multiplier of your teams output. If you are a 10x developer, then your presence
on your team multiplies the team's effectiveness by a factor ten. If you are a
5x developer, your team is five times as effective with your presence.

Obviously, this formulation of what a 10x developer is is not common. I think
that most people think that a 10x developer is one who can produce 10x the
output of an "average" developer. However, development is (for the most part) a
team sport, and a single developer does not have unlimited time and in order for
them to scale their impact, they need to start helping their entire team be more
effective.

So, what about the opposite: a fractional developer. A fractional developer
multiplies their team's effectiveness by a fractional amount. That is, their
presence makes the team _less_ effective.

Let's take a look at examples of a few different multipliers and what qualities
they exhibit:

- 0.1x developer: this developer is a toxic member of the team. They create
  drama within the team and draw managerial resources away from helping others.
