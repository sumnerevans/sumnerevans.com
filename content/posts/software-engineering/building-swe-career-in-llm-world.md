In this article, I am going to discuss software careers in an LLM world.

how you can build a career in the software industry as a software engineer and
adjacent roles in an LLM world. I will provide my view of how LLMs will affect
the software engineering industry and job market. And I describe the steps that
I believe will allow you to adapt to the changes that LLMs are bringing and will
bring.

The primary audience of this talk is computer science students and junior
engineers, as those are the people that I think can benefit the most from this
topic.

I'm not going to sugar coat it: entering the software industry is harder now
than it has been in the past.

- nothing is guaranteed

  - going to college doesn't guarantee a job
  - getting a job doesn't guarantee a career

- career tracks

- stats on age of engineers
