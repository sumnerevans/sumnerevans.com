  Everyone wants to be a 10x developer, but we rarely talk about the opposite of
  a 10x developer: a fractional developer.

A lot of people think that the opposite of a 10x developer is a 1x developer. I
think that is a bad way of framing it. I think that the opposite of a 10x
developer is a 0.1x developer.

First, let me define what I mean when I say a *Y*x developer. _Y_ is a
multiplier of your teams effectiveness. If you are a 10x developer, then your
presence on your team multiplies the team's effectiveness by a factor ten. If
you are a 5x developer, your team is five times as effective with your presence.

Obviously, by this metric, there are basically no 10x developers, and those who
are 10x developers are engineers with huge impact across a large organization
whose initiatives impact

Obviously, this formulation of what a 10x developer is not common. I think that
most people think that a 10x developer is one who can produce 10x the output of
an "average" developer. However, development is (for the most part) a team
sport, and a single developer does not have unlimited time and in order for them
to scale their impact, they need to start helping their entire team be more
effective.

So, what about the opposite: a fractional developer. A fractional developer
multiplies their team's effectiveness by a fractional amount. That is, their
presence makes the team _less_ effective.

Let's take a look at examples of a few different multipliers and what qualities
they exhibit:

- 0.1x developer: this developer is a toxic member of the team. They create
  drama within the team and draw managerial resources away from helping others.
