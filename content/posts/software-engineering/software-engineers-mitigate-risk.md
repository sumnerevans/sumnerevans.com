Besides writing code, what value does a software engineers provide? **Software
engineers _mitigate risk_.** This single phrase explains most of the
non-programming tasks that software engineers perform.

* guide how to market
* guide how to professionally develop

I think that this explains why LLMs will never fully replace software engineers.

It explains why junior engineers are having such a hard time entering the job market:
* they don't know what risks exists to mitigate
* they run right into landmines
* they are like hoping that untested soldiers can hold up against elite Panzer divisions

What differentiates a programmer from a software engineer?

The most important task of a software engineer is to mitigate risk.
