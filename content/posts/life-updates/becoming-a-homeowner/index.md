I recently became a homeowner. Here are a couple of reflections that I've had
about this new phase of life:

* The permanence of owning my own house is nice. The first time this really hit
  me was when I was putting up some decorations. I realized that it was *my*
  walls that I was nailing things in to. I don't have to answer to anyone about
  the holes in my wall if I move out.

* The responsibilities are a bit overwhelming. There are lots of maintenance
  things that I need to remember to do, and I just hope that I can keep up with
  them.

* I feel kinda old now. I literally had an hour long discussion about mortgage
  rates the other day with a friend.

I still don't feel settled, but I think that will come with time. I hope that I
can get to know my neighbours.

It's an exciting new journey, and I'm looking forward to what it brings!
