Today I am happy to announce that I have joined
[Can/Am Technologies](https://canamtechnologies.com) as a Senior Implementation
Tech Lead.

Can/Am makes a point of sale product for local governments called
[Teller](https://www.goteller.com/). I
[worked for Can/Am in the past
as a software developer]({{<ref"../../../portfolio/index.html#experience-canam-software-developer">}})
and I am excited to return after nearly a decade in a new capacity. I will be
leading the engineering team responsible for building integrations with
third-party vendors. I'm excited about the opportunity this position will afford
me to leverage my experience
[teaching
and mentoring students at Mines]({{<ref"../../../portfolio/index.html#experience-adjunct-mines">}})
in a new challenge of leading and mentoring a technical team.

I had an amazing nearly four years at [Beeper](https://beeper.com). It was an
honour to work alongside everyone on the Beeper team. We accomplished many
amazing things together as a team, and I'm proud to have been a small part of
it. I will remember my time at Beeper fondly, and I'm excited to see where the
team takes Beeper in the future!
