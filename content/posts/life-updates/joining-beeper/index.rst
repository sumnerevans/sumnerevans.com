Today I am happy to announce that I have joined Beeper_, a startup that is
building the future of chat by connecting all of your chat networks together in
a single application. I will be primarily working on building bridges to other
chat networks to bring more people into the Beeper ecosystem.

Beeper is built on top of the `Matrix protocol`_ which is an open, decentralized
communication protocol. I have been interested in Matrix since college (we used
it for computer science club communications), and have been following its
development closely for a few years. One of the biggest factors that has caused
me to be interested in the protocol is that it is decentralized by design via
federation. That means that anyone can run a Matrix homeserver and *federate*
(communicate) with all of the other Matrix homeservers in the federation. This
is very similar to how email servers can communicate with one another (you can
email people on Gmail from an Outlook.com email, for example), and you can even
run your own email server!

As censorship and authoritarianism is on the rise around the world, the need for
a communication network that isn't controlled by a single party is becoming
apparent. Decentralized and federated networks such as Matrix are key to
breaking the death-grip that large technology corporations and governments have
on communication. Additionally, the need for strong end-to-end encryption for
communication is becoming apparent, and the Matrix protocol has encryption
built-in.

I have enjoyed the two years I have been at `The Trade Desk`_, and will miss all
of my co-workers there. However, I am excited about this new opportunity to work
at a company that is building a product in an area that I am very passionate
about. In my role at Beeper, I hope to have opportunities to collaborate with
other members of the Matrix community to move the protocol forward. I also hope
that I can help make Matrix accessible to everyone, so that more people can
benefit from open, decentralized communication.
