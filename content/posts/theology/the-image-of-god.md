Recently, I led a Bible study at my college and career group at
[my church](https://littletonbiblechapel.org/). In this post, I intend to

In this post I will first discuss

# Why Does the Doctrine of the Image of God Matter?

# What Does the Bible Have to Say About the Image of God?

I want to now dive into the Bible to see what it has to say about the topic of
the Image of God. I have divided the passages into four sections that each deal
with a different perspective on the Image of God.

## Who Has the Image of God?

The first passages that we will look at discuss who is given the Image of God.
Both passages come from Genesis, the first book of the Bible.

The first passage is **Genesis 1:26-28**
([ESV](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.1.26-28)), and it says:

> <sup>26</sup> Then God said, "Let us make man in our **image**, after our
> **likeness**. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the
> birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over
> every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
> <sup>27</sup> So God created man in his own **image**, in the **image** of God
> he created him; male and female he created them.
> <sup>28</sup> And God blessed them. And God said to them, "Be fruitful and
> multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of
> the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that
> moves on the earth."

This passage is at the end of the Creation account, and is not only the first
mention of the Image of God, but is also the first mention of humanity in the
Bible. In the previous verses, God has created the rest of the physical universe
including all living creatures on the earth, besides mankind. Regardless of the
view you take on the creation narrative[^1], the passage establishes one of the
key ontological distinctions in both Judaism and Christianity: the distinction
between humanity and the rest of the created order.

This passage also describes both male and female as being made equally in the
Image of God.

However, this passage is not without difficulty. Namely, the plural pronouns
"us" and "our" in verse 26. Who is the "us" referring to? If you survey of both
Christian laymen as well as pastors, you would probably find that the vast
majority of them would say that it refers to the Trinity (God the Father, God
the Son, and God the Holy Spirit; the three persons of the Trinity).

In the next few chapters of Genesis, the author describes the entrance of sin
into the world in chapter 3 where Adam and Eve sin against God, and are exiled
from paradise and perfect communion with God is lost.

Then, in chapter 5, at the end of the first main section of Genesis is a
genealogy from Adam to Noah. It begins (vv. 1-3,
[ESV](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.5.1-3)):

> <sup>1</sup> This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created
> man, he made him in the **likeness** of God. <sup>2</sup> Male and female he
> created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created.
> <sup>3</sup> When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own
> **likeness**, after his **image**, and named him Seth.

This passage not only reiterates that all of mankind is made in the Image of God
as first described by Genesis 1, but it also teaches us that the Image of God is
_transferable to offspring_.

[^1]: Examples of views on creation include young-earth creationism, old-earth
creationism, a belief that the creation narative is almost entirely figurative,
and a myriad of other views.
