Happy New Years' Eve! Today was a day at sea. I did a bunch of things
today including: playing chess, playing soccer, eating, reading *The Art
of Computer Programming, Vol. 1, Fundamental Algorithms, Third Edition*
by Donald E. Knuth, eating, watching the Chelsea-Swansea City game, and
watching karaoke.

I could describe the day in detail, but that would be boring, so I
won't. Tomorrow we are in Costa Maya, so that should be more
interesting.
