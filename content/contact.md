You may contact me in a variety of ways. Here are my preferred methods of
communication, listed in order of how quickly you can expect to receive a
response:

* **Matrix:** [`@sumner:sumnerevans.com`](https://matrix.to/#/@sumner:sumnerevans.com)
* **Email:** me [at] sumnerevans [dot] com
* **Social Media:** links to my social media profiles are listed in the footer.

## Security

I prefer E2E encrypted DMs in Matrix.

I use my GPG key for signing git commits, git tags, and emails. If you have a
GPG key and would like me to encrypt my email messages to you, please let me
know.

There are a variety of ways that you can get my GPG key to verify my commits and
emails. Here are a few:

* **sourcehut:** https://meta.sr.ht/~sumner.pgp
* **PGP Keyservers:** You can find my [key on a keyserver][1]. Just
  search for my email. I recommend using http://keys.gnupg.net because the MIT
  keyserver is often overloaded.
* **Right here:**

  My full GPG Key ID is:

      3F15 C22B FD12 5095 F9C0 7275 8904 527A B500 22FD

  You can download my public key here:
  [`sumner-gpg-pubkey.asc`](/sumner-gpg-pubkey.asc).
