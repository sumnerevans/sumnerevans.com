Today we got up fairly early to go to the Tower of London, the castle
around which London was built. We began by going to see the Crown
Jewels, the Royal collection of precious metals, gems and other Royal
items. Many crowns worn by various royalty and some other things like
sceptres are on display. The movies sure don’t exaggerate the brilliance
of the crowns worn by royalty, One interesting thing about the things on
display in the Crown Jewels exhibit is that they are still used today.

After seeing the Crown Jewels, we went to the White Tower, the main
structure in the middle of the fortress. The Royal armoury is on display
there. Everything from suits of armour for various kings and princes to
large cannons were in the collection. There were some exotic weapons as
well such as a highly decorated mace-pistol and a gold plated
semiautomatic gun. They also had a display about the Royal Mint.
Originally, 240 pence equaled one pound because the weight of 240 pence
weighed one pound.

At this point, it was time for a tour guides by the Yeoman Warders, the
guards for the Tower of London. They are nicknamed beefeaters but nobody
really knows exactly why. Our guide said that the most likely
explanation is that the guards were once paid in meat, but the pheasants
outside couldn’t afford anything but vegetables. Therefore, they were
dubbed beefeaters because they had beef.

He took us to the Traitor’s Gate through which many people convicted of
treason were taken over the years. Then he led us to the chapel where he
talked about some of the people buried inside. Most of the people were
convicted of treason (some justly, some not). Three ex-Queens of England
were laid to rest there. The guide pointed out the tower where one of
the Queens was held before her beheading and told some of the other
execution stories surrounding the Tower complex.

After the tour, we went to walk on the tower wall. We could see many of
the major London sites from the wall including Tower Bride, the London
Eye, and the Gherkin to name a few. Towers are placed along the wall,
and many of the rooms had prisoner-graffiti from the various people who
were held there.

We then proceeded out of the Tower to Westminster Abbey. The structure
is very magnificent, but I didn’t like it as much as St. Paul’s because
it felt too much like a graveyard. Many of the English Royalty were
buried here and there were an overwhelming number of shrines, tombs, and
memorials to them and other important figures in English history.

After seeing Westminster Abbey, we went to the Churchill War Rooms, the
office/bunkers of Prime Minister Winston Churchill during WWII. The
museum was very extensive. The included audio guide led us through all
of the offices, meeting rooms, and sleeping quarters in the complex.
I’ll list some of the most interesting things here in no particular
order.

-   The war rooms were merely a converted basement, reinforced as the
    war went on. If there had been a direct hit from a 500 lb bomb, the
    bunker would probably have collapsed.
-   We saw the room where Churchill conducted most of the business of
    the war. When Churchill came to inspect the basement, he declared
    “this is room from which I will direct the war” and it was so.
-   Churchill only slept in the underground bunker overnight three
    times, though he often had his afternoon nap in there.
-   Churchill’s working hours were often from 08:00 until 03:00 the next
    morning.
-   Churchill made a few BBC broadcasts from the bunker and we saw the
    BBC broadcast room and the equipment (or at least a replica thereof)
    for transmitting the broadcast all over the world.
-   We saw the map room where the progress of the conflict was tracked
    and many crucial decisions were made.
-   We saw the conference room where Churchill met with his Chief of
    Staff.
-   Some of the displays told stories of the various people who worked
    in the war rooms during the conflict. They could not tell anyone
    where they were working or what they were doing because if a Nazi
    spy had gotten that information, bye bye war rooms.
-   The war rooms are in very close proximity to 10 Downing St., the
    residence of the Prime Minister, and to the Houses of Parliament.

Inside the museum, there was a large room that gave information about
Churchill’s life. It was very interesting learning about his post and
pre war career. I’ll outline his life chronologically here.

1.  Churchill was born into an aristocratic family. His mother was an
    American, his father a Britton.
2.  He became an MP (Member of Parliament) and quickly rose to the
    position of Lord of the Admiralty (basically the political head of
    the Navy).
3.  His career was nearly ended after the failed Gallipoli invasion of
    which he was the prime orchestrator.
4.  He resigned from his position, and actually served in the army on
    the Western Front for a brief period.
5.  He returned to politics and became Prime Minister after WWII broke
    out. If ever there was a man to lead Britain through the war, it was
    Winston Churchill. His “get stuff done”, no-nonsense attitude, and
    quick wit was just what was needed.
6.  Churchill’s speeches helped keep the morale of the British nation
    up, even in the face of the Luftwaffe’s Blitz.
7.  He was ousted from the Prime Ministership at the end of the war, but
    he remained a prominent figure in international politics. It was at
    this time that he made his famous “Iron Curtain” speech.

Churchill’s life began in the age of cavalry charges and ended during
the nuclear arms race. He made many enemies during his career, but he
knew how to lead Great Britain through WWII.

I spend a good deal of time reading some of his quotes. He has a sense
of humor like mine, dry and very hilarious (if I may say so myself). I
even bought two books of his quotes and excerpts from some of his
speeches.

We went to a very nice Italian restaurant this evening. I had a lasagna
that was very good. Then we went to bed.
