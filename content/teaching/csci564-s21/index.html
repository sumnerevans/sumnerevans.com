<h2>Course Description &amp; Learning Objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description-learning-objectives" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>CSCI 564 is a course covering <strong>advanced topics in computer architecture,
including pipelining, caching, virtual memory, storage, multi-core processing
and power</strong>. We will focus on understanding the various options available to
computer architects when designing computer systems, with an emphasis on
developing quantitative justifications for those options.</p>
<p>In addition to being invaluable for computer architects, this topic is highly
relevant for both future software engineers and computer scientists. Software
engineers rely on performance gains made in the field of computer architecture,
and understanding the fundamentals of concepts such as the memory hierarchy
helps guide software engineers’ optimization strategies. Additionally, concepts
such as caching are widespread in industry (albeit mainly at a higher level than
the caches we will discuss). Future computer scientists will benefit from this
class because it quantifies many core concepts of the underlying hardware of all
modern computing systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expectations">
<h2>Expectations<a class="headerlink" href="#expectations" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is <strong>highly recommended</strong> that you use Linux for all of the projects in this
course. If you choose to use a different type of system (such as macOS or
Windows), the instructor nor the TAs will not be able to assist you with any
platform-specific issues.</p>
<p>Students are also expected to have be able to write either C or C++ before
entering this course. <em>Neither the instructor nor the TA will help debug your
code for you.</em></p>

<h2>Grading Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-policy" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course is worth 1000 points. The points are allocated as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Midterm.</strong> 100 points.</li>
<li><strong>Final.</strong> 200 points.</li>
<li><strong>Three Projects.</strong> Total 400 points.<ul>
<li>Project 1: Cache Replacement Policies Simulator. 150 points.</li>
<li>Project 2: Cache Prefetcher Simulator. 100 points.</li>
<li>Project 3: Branch Prediction Simulator. 150 points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Four Homework Assignments.</strong> Total 200 points. 50 points each.</li>
<li><strong>Class Participation (Mainly Worksheets).</strong> 100 points.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your grade letter will be derived using the <strong>standard plus-minus grading
scale</strong>. The instructor reserves the right to move the scale down, but it will
never move up.</p>
<p>All projects will be due at 23:59 of the day listed on the schedule. The penalty
for late submissions is 20% per day. If you need an extension for any reason,
email the instructor to work something out.</p>
<div class="section" id="autograded-projects">
<h3>Autograded Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#autograded-projects" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most programming assignments have an auto-graded component where a portion of
your grade is calculated immediately upon submission. The grading scripts are
designed to mark all fully correct programs as correct, and do the best job
possible assigning partial credit where applicable. However, under some cases,
you may not receive as many points as you deserve. If you believe this to be the
case, contact the course instructor so they can either fix the autograder to
handle your case better, or manually grade your assignment.</p>
<p>You are only allowed 3 submissions on autograded homework. This is because your
grade is received quickly after submitting, and it may be tempting to use the
autograder as the only means of testing. Students are expected to test their
own code before submitting. If you run out of submissions and need more, then
contact the instructor.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Autograded assigments are reviewed for plagarism a few weeks after the
deadline, not when graded. While copying an assigment from another student
may give you a good grade in the short term, the long term consequences
could be severe. Plagarism is taken very seriously on these assignments.</p>

<div class="section" id="collaboration-policy-for-programming-projects-in-cs-courses">
<h2>Collaboration Policy for Programming Projects in CS Courses<a class="headerlink" href="#collaboration-policy-for-programming-projects-in-cs-courses" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following policy exists for all courses in the CS department. This policy
is a minimum standard; your instructor may decide to augment this policy.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If the project is an individual effort project, you are not allowed to give
code you have developed to another student or use code provided by another
student. If the project is a group project, you are only allowed to share
code with your group members.</li>
<li>You are encouraged to discuss programming projects with other students in
the class, as long as the following rules are followed:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>You view another student’s code only for the purpose of offering or
receiving debugging assistance. Students can only give advice on what
problems to look for; they cannot debug your code for you. <strong>All changes
to your code must be made by you.</strong></li>
<li>Your discussion is subject to the <strong>empty hands policy</strong>, which means you
leave the discussion without any record (electronic, mechanical, or
otherwise) of the discussion.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Any material from any outside source such as books, projects, and in
particular, from the Web, should be properly referenced and should only be
used if specifically allowed for the assignment.</li>
<li>To prevent unintended sharing, any code stored in a hosted repository (e.g.,
on GitHub) must be private. For group projects, your team members may, of
course, be collaborators.</li>
<li>If you are aware of students violating this policy, you are encouraged to
inform the professor of the course. Violating this policy will be treated as
an academic misconduct for all students involved. See the Student Handbook
for details on academic dishonesty.</li>
</ol>

received your letter of accommodations, please contact your instructor at your
earliest convenience so you can discuss your needs in this course. For
questions or other inquiries regarding disabilities, we encourage you to visit
