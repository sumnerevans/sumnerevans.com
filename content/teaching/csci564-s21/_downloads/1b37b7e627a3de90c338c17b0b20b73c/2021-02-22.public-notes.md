* I thought about the effect of prefetchers on compulsory misses, and realized
  that what I said was incorrect last time.

  If the prefetcher is too aggressive, it could potentially kick out values that
  it prefetched, but this will not make the number of compulsory misses any
  worse than if we did not have prefetching.

* Project 2 builds off of Project 1

* It is important to at least get the random trials average correct. There is a
  very low probability that that is off if you have the right implementation.

* 4.2 and 4.1

  * Write-back, no-write allocate
    * Doesn't make much sense
  * Write-back, write allocate
    * Advantage: no need to write to higher level caches on write, takes
      advantage of temporal locality.
    * Has the downside of potentially pulling in a lot of lines that we don't
      need and polluting the cache. Since it's write-back, it will also cause
      writes to take a while because the eviction will take a while.
  * Write-through, no-write allocate
    * Advantage: no unnecessary evictions when all we need to do is write
    * Disadvantage: write-through is slow, doesn't take advantage of temporal
      locality
  * Write-through, write-allocate
    * Advantage: can use temporal locality
    * Disadvantage: write-through is slow, may cause unnecessary evictions
