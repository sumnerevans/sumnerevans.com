Office Hours
============

* Sumner's primary office hours are on **Mondays from 18:00-19:00** (right after
  class), and **Fridays from 16:00-17:00**. Both office hours are held on
  **Mumble** (see below). Sumner is also available by appointment. If you have a
  question about logistics (for example, grades), it is recommended to set up an
  appointment if possible to keep office hours focused on content.
* Adam's office hours are on **Tuesdays 13:00-15:00** on **Zoom** at this link:
