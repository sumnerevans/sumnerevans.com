LGA-04: Object Oriented Programming
===================================

For this LGA, all you need to do ahead of time is watch one of the following
two YouTube videos:

* `OOP is Bad`__
* `Stop Writing Classes`__

Before you leave class, assign who is watching each video, such that a roughly
equal number of people in your group watch each video.

All you have to do is watch and come prepared to have a discussion. I will give
you credit for participating in the discussion.
