LGA-05: Exam 1 Questions
========================

In the next class, we will be having a review session to prepare for Exam 1. You
will be reviewing with your learning group members.

Each member of your learning group must create 2-4 questions (depending on the
difficulty of each of the problems) which might appear on the test. If you are
feeling uninspired, look at the `Exam 1 Topics`_ for ideas.

Bring a **printed** copy of your questions for each member of your learning
group.
