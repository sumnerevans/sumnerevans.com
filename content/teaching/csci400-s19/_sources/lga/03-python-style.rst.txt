LGA-03: Python Style
====================

You can complete this LGA individually, or as a group (if you meet up outside
of class). It's up to you and your group.

Read the `Python Style Guide (PEP 8) <PEP 8_>`_. Note down a few things that
intrigue you, you think are a good idea, or you're not sure why they are a
style requirement. Then, provide answers the following questions:

1. What are some advantages of an official language style guide? Disadvantages?
2. What does the style guide mean by "A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of
   Little Minds"?
3. Python allows you to use either parentheses or a backslash to continue a
   line. When might one be more appropriate than the other? Support your answer
   with examples.
4. Should ``camelCase`` ever be used in Python?
5. What is a "docstring"? Give an example of a function with a docstring.
6. Name one style habit you'll have to break while coding in Python.
