LGA-06: Memory Management
=========================

Split this between your group. If you only have 3 members, you only need to
complete three as a group. If you have four, one question should be completed
twice.

1. Research what is **reference counting**. Can you explain it to a student in
   CSCI-262? *Name a few ways that reference counting garbarge collectors deal
   with circular references.*

2. Research what is a smart pointer in C++. Can you explain it to a student in
   CSCI-262? *What issues do C++ smart pointers solve with explicit heap
   dynamic lifetimes?*

3. Write a simple C program with a memory leak. Research the **valgrind** tool.
   Be prepared to demonstrate how to use valgrind to show that the program is
   leaking memory to your learning group.
