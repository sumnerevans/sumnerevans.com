LGA-08: Parsing
===============

This can either be completed individually, or as a group outside of class.

1. Read the docstring for the ``lex`` function in SlytherLisp (under
   ``slyther/parser.py``. Write the tokens for this string::

      (print (eval ''(1 2 (3 4))) 5)

2. Design a set of production rules which could be used to parse SlytherLisp.
   Ask on Piazza if you're stuck and need help!

3. Use your production rules to parse the string in Part 1 using the
   shift-reduce method and create a parse table.
