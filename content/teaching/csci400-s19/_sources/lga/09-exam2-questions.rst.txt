LGA-09: Exam 2 Questions
========================

In the next class, we will be having a review session to prepare for Exam 2. You
will be reviewing with your learning group members.

Each member of your learning group must create 2-4 questions which might appear
on the test. If you are feeling uninspired, look at the `Exam 2 Topics`_ for
ideas.

Bring a **printed** copy of your questions for each member of your learning
group.
