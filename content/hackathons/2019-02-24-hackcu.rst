A couple of weeks ago, I, along with nearly 30 other Mines students, attended
the HackCU hackathon at CU Boulder.

Since the hackathon was so close and since I was driving up to the hackathon, I
decided to bring *all* of my electronics. I brought my desktop, my ThinkPad, my
MacBook Pro, my iPad, a Raspberry Pi, and a variety of other assorted cables and
electronics.
