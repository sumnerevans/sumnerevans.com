- Think a bit ahead

  - Things that bug you
  - Technology that you want to use
  - Problems that you want to solve

- While there:

  - Decide your project quickly. At a 24 hour hackathon, you can only afford to
    spend half-an-hour on this (at most).

  - Think big, then figure out what the minimal Proof-of-Concept would be

    - Think big helps during demos because you can then talk about the future of
      your app.

  - Strive to learn something new. Maybe don't learn an entirely new language or
    platform (it worked for us, but YMMV)

  - Create clear, separate tasks for people to do, but not too separate.

  - Do what works, and do it fast. Test quickly, and connect all of the
    components as soon as possible.

  - Think about what to demo constantly. As you code, your project idea may even
    change, but make sure that you have an idea of what you want to show to the
    judges at all time. Time coding anything that will not be shown to the
    judges is a waste of time (unless it's for a contingency plan, such as using
    GPS instead of ARCore to locate the user just in case everything else went
    south)

  - Communicate with one another constantly, make sure that nobody is blocked.
    Blocked people don't write code that gets demoed.

  - Sell the idea to yourself. Even if you don't like the idea that much, make
    yourself like it. No, make yourself **love** it. If you aren't convinced
    it's amazing, you won't convince the judges that it's amazing.

  - Have fun. It's a competition, but this is also what you enjoy doing. You are
    here to write a bunch of code, eat really poorly, and hang out with friends.
    Winning is just an added benefit.

  - Be willing to pivot. Something will inevitably go wrong, you will have to
    course correct, and you may even need to start over from scratch.

- Demos

  - Make sure that you have a good motivation. Don't make it too contrived. It
    doesn't have to be your sick grandma that inspired you, it can just be that
    you are terrible at navigating new buildings, or that you have trouble
    parking at school. Anything to let the judges connect with your project is
    good.

  - Demos are the classic "heroes story", present the problem, then *pow* your
    app solves all of your problems. Here's how (and describe the cool things
    your app does)

  - Show the features of your app, not the tech. Features are what make money,
    feature are what win hackathons.

  - It's fine to mention the technology you used (especially if you are
    targeting a sponsor prize, or are using a cutting-edge technology), but
    that's not the primary focus of the demo. This is especially true when you
    have non-technical judges. When you start "talking computer" their brain
    turns off and you automatically are out of the running. With a technical
    judge, they hear the tech that you are using and then may have questions
    about it, and that's where you can really shine (see below).

  - Script it, but not too much. Be natural, it helps add humanity to your
    presentation.

  - Make sure you have a list of words/phrases that you *really* want to make
    sure you say. You may not hit all of them, and that's ok, but hit as many of
    them as you can.

- Questions

  - Always say that your app can do whatever they ask if it can do. If the
    judge asks if it can make breakfast, think of some way that it can help them
    make breakfast (even if that's an entirely ridiculous idea).

  - Be prepared to elaborate on the technology that you used. If your judge(s)
    are technical, your demo should have whetted their appetite(s) just enough
    for them to want to ask question about how exactly you used said technology.

- General stuff

  - Back each other up, especially during demos. If somebody is totally bombing
    the demo, do something to rescue the situation. The classic "as you can
    tell, it's very complicated... so now we want to <do something else that is
    not whatever train wreck you were on before>"

  - Pretend to know what you are doing. Fake it 'til you make it is a real
    strategy at hackathons.

  - Respect the other competitors

  - Everything that you ever learned about teamwork applies

  - If you are the put-a-team-together type of person, make sure that you cover
    your own weaknesses with your teammates.

    - Sam: writes a lot of code
    - Jack: solid with algorithms, great to pair with
    - Fisher: dark horse

  - Be competitive, but not too competitive. Don't let your competitiveness take
    away from the fun of hanging out with friends for 24+ hours and not
    sleeping.
