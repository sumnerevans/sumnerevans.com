Objectively, I'm pretty good at winning prizes at hackathons. I'm not entirely
sure how/why, but I am. In this article I intend to try and describe some of the
things which have helped me and my teams at hackathons.  Please note that these
are merely my experiences. Your mileage may vary.

Before I can talk about how to win a hackathon, we need to be clear about the
definition of a hackathon. A hackathon is **not** a competition where you try
and crack into computer systems [1]_. Rather, it is a competition where you are
given a period of time (normally between 24 and 36 hours) to create a project.
We call the projects *hacks* because they are very *hacky*, that is, they are
not pretty when you look "under the hood", so to speak.

Why You Should Listen to Me
---------------------------

I have been to five hackathons and successfully created and demoed a project at
each of them. At the `Xilinx`_ hackathon, my team won the Grand Prize. At
`MinneHack 2018`_, we did not win anything, but gained valuable experience. At
`HackCU`_, we won Judges Favorite, Best Use of AWS, and the Dish Network sponsor
challenge. At `MHacks`_, we won Best Use of GCP and the Facebook Best Social
Good Hack award at MHacks. Most recently at the `Global Hackathon Finals at
Facebook <facebook_>`_, we won First Place.

As you can tell, I have some experience with hackathons, and a good track record
of success at them as well. However, hackathons are a team effort. Three of the
hackathons (Xilinx, MHacks, Facebook) I was on a team with Sam Sartor. Three of
the hackathons (MinneHack, HackCU, MHacks) I was on a team with Robby Zampino.
Two of the hackathons (MinneHack, HackCU), I was on a team with David Florness.
Two of the hackathons (HackCU, Facebook), I was on a team with Jack Garner.  Two
of the hackathons (Xilinx, MinneHack), I was on a team with Jack Rosenthal.  Two
of the hackathons (MHacks, Facebook), I was on a team with Fisher Darling.  One
hackathon (Xilinx), I was on a team with Daichi Jameson.  Each of them were
amazing teammates at the various hackathons, and I definitely would not be
writing this article if it were not for each of them.

To answer the actual question though, why should you listen to me? No real
reason, actually. I'm just someone who has some experience and some degree of
success and I hope that you can learn from both my mistakes and my successes.

The rest of this article is split into a five sections, each dealing with a
separate part of hackathons.

2. How to prepare for a hackathon.
3. What to do at a hackathon.
4. Things to do during hackathon demos.

1. How to Form a Team for a Hackathon
-------------------------------------

If you want to win a hackathon, you need a good team. If you are the type of
person who is inclined towards leadership, then you should be actively looking
for people who you want to be on your team. For me, since I'm in the Mines ACM
chapter, I have formed teams with people within that group.

The most important thing is to make sure that you like all of your teammates.
You will have to deal with them for an entire day (sometimes more), so the last
thing you want is unnecessary tension within the team. Two other important
qualities of hackathon teammates are a passion for engineering (hackathons are
mini tests of engineering prowess) and the ability to compete and work hard,
while still having a ton of fun.

You may notice that I do *not* consider "technical competence" is one of the top
three most important qualities in a hackathon teammate. That's because I believe
that people who are diligent and passionate can overcome technical incompetency
fairly easily. This is not to say that technical competence is not a factor to
consider, however. In fact, I generally try to ensure that I cover my own
weaknesses with my teammates. For example, Robby is an Electrical Engineer and
has a lot more hardware experience that I do (my knowledge is approximately zero
in that department). Sam is great with mathematics and algorithms, and just is
generally one of the best programmers that I know.

Since technical competence is not a large factor in my decisions for who to ask
to be on my teams for hackathons, I often like asking some underclassmen to be
on my team. For HackCU, I asked Jack and David (both freshmen) to be on my team.
I knew they were pretty good students, and they were involved in ACM projects so
I was pretty sure they'd do well at the hackathon, but they definitely
out-performed any of my or Robby's expectations. They were integral to our
success at that hackathon. For MHacks, I asked Fisher (freshman) to be on my
team. He likewise was a integral part of the team's success at both MHacks and
the subsequent Facebook hackathon.

2. How to Prepare for a Hackathon
---------------------------------

Besides putting together a team, there are a few things which you should
probably do before the hackathon even starts. Some teams do a lot of
preparation, and even come to the hackathon with an idea. I'm not that
organized/proactive, but I do try and prepare myself for the hackathon. Here are
a few tips:

**Do your homework.**
  Your literal homework. It's not very fun if you have to worry about doing
  homework during a hackathon. Make sure that you get ahead on your work so that
  you don't have to stress about it or feel like you need to be getting other
  stuff done the whole time.

  If you aren't in school, make sure that you clear your other responsibilities
  (whatever they may be) out of the way.

**Start thinking about what you may want to do at the hackathon.**
  Keep track of all the times you think to yourself, "hey, it'd be cool if..."
  and "man, this is terrible". Just keeping track of this will get your creative
  juices flowing. It is a lot easier to steer a ship that is moving than one
  that is still. The same applies to your brain as it explores the set of
  problems which you could attempt to solve.

  In addition to keeping your eyes open for things that bug you, start thinking
  about what technology you want to use at the hackathon. This requires that you
  are in-tune with the current state of technology, and know interests you.
  Often, I've shown up to a hackathon with a hammer (technology) looking for a
  nail (problem).

**Think big.**
  Think of lots of ideas that are super big. Sometimes it's useful to start with
  huge problems like "world hunger" and then think about different problems in
  that space and see if some cool idea arises from that.

  One example of this was the Facebook hackathon. I'd been wanting to do indoor
  mapping using just the fire escape floor-plans of buildings for a while, and
  the hackathon was a great opportunity to take a stab at it.

3. What to Do at a Hackathon
----------------------------

4. Things to do during hackathon demos

5. General tips
---------------

.. [1] Many people have a misconception of the word *hack*. In the common
   vernacular, *hacking* is used to refer to an act which is more correctly
   decribed as *cracking*. *Crackers* are people who try and break in to systems
   (either maliciously or as white-hats). *Hack* on the other hand is an
   word describing the quality of a technical idea/project. Hacks are things
   which *work*, but are very messy. Think of it like using duct-tape to hang
   something up on a wall instead of doing the "right" thing which would be to
   hang it up using a nail.

- While there:

  - Decide your project quickly. At a 24 hour hackathon, you can only afford to
    spend half-an-hour on this (at most).

  - Think big, then figure out what the minimal Proof-of-Concept would be

    - Think big helps during demos because you can then talk about the future of
      your app.

  - Strive to learn something new. Maybe don't learn an entirely new language or
    platform (it worked for us, but YMMV)

  - Create clear, separate tasks for people to do, but not too separate.

  - Do what works, and do it fast. Test quickly, and connect all of the
    components as soon as possible.

  - Think about what to demo constantly. As you code, your project idea may even
    change, but make sure that you have an idea of what you want to show to the
    judges at all time. Time coding anything that will not be shown to the
    judges is a waste of time (unless it's for a contingency plan, such as using
    GPS instead of ARCore to locate the user just in case everything else went
    south)

  - Communicate with one another constantly, make sure that nobody is blocked.
    Blocked people don't write code that gets demoed.

  - Sell the idea to yourself. Even if you don't like the idea that much, make
    yourself like it. No, make yourself **love** it. If you aren't convinced
    it's amazing, you won't convince the judges that it's amazing.

  - Have fun. It's a competition, but this is also what you enjoy doing. You are
    here to write a bunch of code, eat really poorly, and hang out with friends.
    Winning is just an added benefit.

  - Be willing to pivot. Something will inevitably go wrong, you will have to
    course correct, and you may even need to start over from scratch.

- Demos

  - Make sure that you have a good motivation. Don't make it too contrived. It
    doesn't have to be your sick grandma that inspired you, it can just be that
    you are terrible at navigating new buildings, or that you have trouble
    parking at school. Anything to let the judges connect with your project is
    good.

  - Demos are the classic "heroes story", present the problem, then *pow* your
    app solves all of your problems. Here's how (and describe the cool things
    your app does)

  - Show the features of your app, not the tech. Features are what make money,
    feature are what win hackathons.

  - It's fine to mention the technology you used (especially if you are
    targeting a sponsor prize, or are using a cutting-edge technology), but
    that's not the primary focus of the demo. This is especially true when you
    have non-technical judges. When you start "talking computer" their brain
    turns off and you automatically are out of the running. With a technical
    judge, they hear the tech that you are using and then may have questions
    about it, and that's where you can really shine (see below).

  - Script it, but not too much. Be natural, it helps add humanity to your
    presentation.

  - Make sure you have a list of words/phrases that you *really* want to make
    sure you say. You may not hit all of them, and that's ok, but hit as many of
    them as you can.

- Questions

  - Always say that your app can do whatever they ask if it can do. If the
    judge asks if it can make breakfast, think of some way that it can help them
    make breakfast (even if that's an entirely ridiculous idea).

  - Be prepared to elaborate on the technology that you used. If your judge(s)
    are technical, your demo should have whetted their appetite(s) just enough
    for them to want to ask question about how exactly you used said technology.

- General stuff

  - Back each other up, especially during demos. If somebody is totally bombing
    the demo, do something to rescue the situation. The classic "as you can
    tell, it's very complicated... so now we want to <do something else that is
    not whatever train wreck you were on before>"

  - Pretend to know what you are doing. Fake it 'til you make it is a real
    strategy at hackathons.

  - Respect the other competitors

  - Everything that you ever learned about teamwork applies

  - If you are the put-a-team-together type of person, make sure that you cover
    your own weaknesses with your teammates.

    - Sam: writes a lot of code
    - Jack: solid with algorithms, great to pair with
    - Fisher: dark horse

  - Be competitive, but not too competitive. Don't let your competitiveness take
    away from the fun of hanging out with friends for 24+ hours and not
    sleeping.
