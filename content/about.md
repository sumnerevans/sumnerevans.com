My name is Sumner, and I live in Denver, Colorado. I am a Senior Implementation
Tech Lead at [Can/Am Technologies](https://canamtechnologies.com/) and I run a
business called [Nevarro](https://nevarro.space) which provides education
services such as computer science and mathematics tutoring. I'm also a 4th
Degree Black Belt and certified instructor in ATA Taekwondo and a Colorado
School of Mines alum (bachelor's in CS, 2018; masters in CS, 2019).

I like building software which solves difficult and real problems, and I enjoy
helping others develop their careers in software. I have had the opportunity to
solve many interesting and difficult problems throughout my career. I have also
had the opportunity to
[teach multiple computer science courses at a university
level]({{<ref"./portfolio/index.html#experience-adjunct-mines">}}).

In my [job at Can/Am]({{<ref"/portfolio#experience-canam-tech-lead">}}) I lead
the engineering team responsible for building integrations with third-party
vendors. I've been working to improve team processes and define expectations for
engineers.

Previously, I [worked at Beeper]({{<ref"/portfolio#experience-beeper">}})
building lots of things related to the Matrix protocol including cryptography
libraries[^1] and the [mautrix bridges](https://github.com/mautrix). I also
started and was a core member of the
[Hungryserv]({{<ref"/portfolio#presentation-hungryserv">}}) project which
enabled us to scale from hundreds to tens of thousands of users. I wrote about
the technical and community aspects of [Matrix on my blog](/categories/matrix),
and I've given a few talks related to Matrix at conferences[^2]. I was
[elected to the Matrix Governing Board](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board-elections/#elected-representatives)
as an individual member in 2024.

When I'm not programming, I enjoy training in ATA taekwondo under Chief Master
Corina Black where I am a 4th Degree Black Belt and certified Level 3 Certified
Legacy Instructor. I also enjoy playing soccer, volleyball, and racquetball when
I have the chance. During high school, I won the FRCCA Soccer State Championship
with Denver Eagles my senior year. I have also won multiple state titles in ATA
taekwondo.
