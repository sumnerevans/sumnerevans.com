My name is Sumner, and I live in Denver, Colorado. I am a Software Engineer at
[Automattic](https://automattic.com/) working on [Beeper](https://beeper.com/)
and I run a business called [Nevarro](https://nevarro.space) which is dedicated
to building and self-hosting open source software and providing educational
services such as computer science and mathematics tutoring. I'm also a 4th
Degree Black Belt and certified instructor in ATA Taekwondo and a Colorado
School of Mines alum (bachelor's in CS, 2018; masters in CS, 2019).

I believe that free speech is essential to a functioning democratic system. I
believe that guaranteeing free speech in the digital space is essential. I
believe that the best way to guarantee free speech is to ensure that every
individual controls their own data, rather than having it be owned by Big Tech.
Thus, I'm passionate about making data ownership accessible to the masses. I
believe that decentralized and federated systems are essential to providing this
accessibility. Right now, the best federated chat system is Matrix, and so most
of my effort is currently going towards furthering [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
in various forms.

In my job at Beeper (acquired by Automattic), I am a member of the Platform Team
which is responsible for building Matrix bridges and developing our Go client
SDK. I'm particularly proud of the work that I've done to bring support for
[key backup](https://github.com/mautrix/go/tree/main/crypto/backup) and
[interactive verification](https://github.com/mautrix/go/tree/main/crypto/verificationhelper)
to [maturix-go](https://github.com/mautrix/go). I also have helped build and
maintain the wide set of
[bridges that Beeper maintains](https://github.com/beeper), and I started and
was a core member of the
[Hungryserv]({{<ref"/portfolio#presentation-hungryserv">}}) project which
enabled us to scale from hundreds to tens of thousands of users.

Outside of my job, I run my own Matrix homeserver and bridges. I also write and
host a few Matrix bots. I have written about the technical and community aspects
of [Matrix on my blog](/categories/matrix), and I've given a few talks related
to Matrix at conferences
([Matrix Cryptographic Key Infrastructure]({{<ref"/portfolio#presentation-matrix-crypto-key-infra">}}),
[Hungryserv: A Homeserver Optimized for Unfederated Use-Cases]({{<ref"/portfolio#presentation-hungryserv">}}),
[What is Beeper Working on?]({{<ref"/portfolio#presentation-what-is-beeper-working-on">}})).
I was recently
[elected to the Matrix Governing Board](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board-elections/#elected-representatives)
as an individual member. My goal is to represent the interests of the community
to the Foundation. You can read
[my platform]({{<ref"./posts/matrix/2024-matrix-governing-board.md">}}) which
lays out the most important issues that the Foundation has to address moving
forward. My DMs are open if you are a member of the Matrix community and have
questions or concerns about the Foundation or what we as the Governing Board are
doing.

When I'm not programming, I enjoy training in ATA Taekwondo under Chief Master
Corina Black where I am a 4th Degree Black Belt and certified Level 3 Certified
Legacy Instructor. I also enjoy playing soccer, volleyball, and racquetball when
I have the chance. During high school, I won the FRCCA Soccer State Championship
with Denver Eagles my senior year. I have also won multiple state titles in
Taekwondo.
