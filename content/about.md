Hello, welcome to my website! I am so glad you stopped by to check it out!

Let me introduce myself. My name is Sumner, I am 23 years old and live in
Denver, Colorado. I am a Software Engineer at [Beeper](https://beeper.com/) and
an Adjunct Professor at [Colorado School of Mines](https://mines.edu). I am a
Colorado School of Mines alum (bachelor's in CS, 2018; masters in CS, 2019).
Previously, I have worked at [The Trade Desk](https://thetradedesk.com) and
[Can/Am Technologies](https://canamtechnologies.com/).

Things I'm passionate about:

* Programming
* Computer Science
* Software Architecture and Software Engineering
* Self hosting and data ownership
* Free and Open Source Software
* Distributed systems
* CS Education

I'm grateful to have a great job where I am able to exercise my passions. On the
side, I also work on a variety of open source projects, which you can find on my
[portfolio][1].

When I'm not working, I enjoy playing soccer, volleyball, and racquetball. I
also train in ATA Taekwondo where I am a 3rd Degree Black Belt. During high
school, I won the FRCCA State Championship with Denver Eagles my senior year,
and won multiple state titles in Taekwondo.

This site is the place to get updates on my life. I maintain a [blog](/) here
where I post occasionally. I post about my travels, technology, education,
projects updates, politics, and many other random topics. On my portfolio page,
I have an up-to-date overview of [my professional achievements][1]. I also have
an always-up-to-date link to my [resume](/portfolio/resume.pdf) there. You can
also find links to all of the social media accounts that I actually use in the
footer of this site.

Happy reading!
