Sumner:  
It was about a for hour trip to Shaghai and then we had an eight hour
layover. It was long and hard. We ate a meal and shoped and bored
ourselfs to death. Finally the gate opened and we checked our bags and
went to the plane. It was a ten and a half hour flight to San Fransisco.
I slept and worked on my blog for most of it. We had thought that all
the movies that they were playing were going to be bad. One of the ones
that they showed was Ramona and Besis. I would have watched it but I
thought that it was another of those bad movies and nobody told me that
I could watch it. We made it to San Fran and had a three hour layover.
Then we had another three hour flight to Denver. We bussed out to our
car and were a little worried that our car wouldn't start. It did and we
drove to our house. Hannah slept all the way and mom and I dosed off for
a minute or so. Dad luckily didn't dose off and we made it home safe.  
That concludes our trip. We had a great time and I think that it was
just the right length because by the end of our trip I was ready to go
back home.
