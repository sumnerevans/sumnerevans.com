Since we were at sea today with nothing in particular to do, I slept in quite a
bit. I woke up and went upstairs just when the ping pong tournament was
starting. I am decent at ping pong, but there are some really good players on
this cruise, so I'm happy when I win a game before losing.

Anyway, after that I had breakfast and then spent the day swimming, playing ping
pong and soccer, and hanging out with people on the boat.

Then we went to dinner and the show (which was ok; it was just the Zuiderdam
singers and dancers and wasn't anything to write home about). After the show I
went to *BILLBOARD on Board* for a while before going to bed.
