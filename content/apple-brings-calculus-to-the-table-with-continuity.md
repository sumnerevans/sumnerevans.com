There is a concept in calculus called Continuity. Basically, if you have
a graph without any holes (x values for which y is undefined) or
vertical asymptotes (I'm not going to try to explain), it is continuous.
With iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, Apple is bringing Calculus to the table
with Continuity. (Just in case your head has been in the sand for the
last couple of months, Continuity is a feature in iOS 8 and OS X
Yosemite that makes it easy to move to a different device and work on
the same thing. No calculus required.)

I must be fair the competition though, Samsung is bringing the Galaxy to
the table with their devices. (Well, at least a Galaxy of junkware...)
