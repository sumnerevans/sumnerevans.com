We arrived in Stockholm at around 12:30 local time. Unfortunately I did
doze off in the plane on our way here for about an hour, so I didn’t
succeed in my original goal of not sleeping on they flight. I’m going to
try and make up for it by staying up until 21:00 tonight.

Two of our bags took forever to come out, but we finally got them and
found the train into Stockholm. We had gotten the wrong tickets (Hannah
had a pensioner’s ticket) but the lady was nice and told us that both
Hannah and I were free and that we should just ask for a refund once we
got to the station in Stockholm. The guy at the station didn’t ask any
questions and gave us the refund. It was a good introduction to
Stockholm.

After checking in at the hotel, we went out into the town to try and
find somewhere to eat. We were trying to find a restaurant with Swedish
food, but royally failed. I think we would have found something if we
were more awake. In the end we went to a Chinese buffet. The food was
good, but the best part of the meal was watching mom try to stay awake.
At once point, she dozed off to sleep (I think her brain turned off but
here eyes didn’t close, I don’t know). She must have had some sort of a
dream because she randomly said “Did you get the right meat?” which had
nothing to do with any conversation we had been having. Maybe it isn’t
very funny after writing it down, but it was hilarious when it happened,
especially since we were all so tired, I think everything seemed funny.

After we got back, we wanted to go to sleep so badly, but it was only
15:00. Mom and I went back out to try and find a SIM card for a phone
that we have. We did find one and came back to the hotel. It’s now
20:57, so I’m going to get ready to go to bed.
