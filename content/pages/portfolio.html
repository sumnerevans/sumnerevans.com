          I worked on the Teller Development Team designing and building new features for Teller, an
          enterprise point-of-sale system geared towards municipal governments.
        </p>

        <p>
          I primarily worked on the web-based application which uses a technology stack consisting
          of Ext JS (a JavaScript framework), C#.NET, and Oracle PL/SQL, but I also worked on the
          native Windows application. Additionally, I designed and built plugins that integrate
          external systems into Teller.

          Wireless Debugging is a mobile SDK and sample web server for streaming mobile app logs to
          a web UI console. I worked on this project on a team of five CS students during Mines
          Computer Science Field Session. This project was done under supervision of Google.
        </p>

        <p>
          We designed and built a mobile API, log parsing library, datastore interface, user
          management interface, and web app. I was the primary writer of the API Specification for
          communicating between each component. I also built the log parsing library and the mobile
          API implementation for iOS. I was involved in the development of the other components as
          well.

          Chess++ was my final project for CSCI 261 at Colorado School of Mines during the Summer II
          Semester of 2016.
