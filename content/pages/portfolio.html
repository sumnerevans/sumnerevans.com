          MLocate is a comprehensive system for tracking and locating devices within an indoor space
          just using Wi-Fi ping signals. Using three specially configured Wi-Fi access points, we
          were able to capture signal strength from every device in the room by MAC address. Then,
          applying Radio Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) models, we were able to derive distance
          from signal strength which allowed us to use standard triangulation algorithms for
          determining the location of all of every device in the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked on the triangulation logic for pinpointing device locations given distances
          calculated from signal strength. I also built the web frontend for displaying device
          locations.

          HypAR Map helps users navigate around unfamiliar locations by overlaying a map of the area
          using augmented reality. The map can come from any photo (for example, a fire escape plan)
          and is calibrated using an intuitive user interface. HypAR Map then uses simultaneous
          location and mapping to find and display the location of the user in the map in real-time.

          I worked on the image import functionality and worked with all of the members of the team

          Datanium is a large-scale network of Raspberry Pis which allow for human-powered transfer
          of data between places with internet access and places which do not. In the Datanium
          ecosystem, there are two different types of users: consumers and couriers. Consumers
          request data, and Datanium ensures that couriers move the requested data to the Datanium
          Node closest to the consuming user. Datanium does this coordination using only SMS.
        </p>

          I worked on the web frontend for requesting and uploading data to the Datanium nodes.

          Wii-Track is a distributed inventory tracking system. It utilizes a WiiFit, Rasberry Pi,
          and Arduino to gather information about packages. All heavy computation is done on AWS
          Lambda and it uses the DynamoDB NoSQL database as a backend.

          I wrote this creative writing piece about Orville and Wilbur Wright and the first flight
          at Kitty Hawk for my Twentieth Century World History class in Fall 2013. I had written
          this piece for an assignment called <em>A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words</em>. We were
          tasked with writing an approximately 1000 word narrative from the perspective of a person
          in a significant photo from the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. Later in 2013 I was published in
          <em>CLARO</em> Red Rock Community College's Interdisciplinary Scholarly Journal. In May
          2014, I
