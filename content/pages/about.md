title: About

Hello, welcome to my website! I am so glad you stopped by to check it out!

Let me introduce myself. My name is Sumner, I am 20 years old and live in
Denver, Colorado. I am a Senior in Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines.
After I graduate, I am going to stay at Mines to complete a Masters Degree in
Computer Science through the five-year masters degree program.

Computers are my passion. I really enjoy programming and the computer science
courses I've taken so far at Mines have been very interesting. I run Arch Linux
on my 15" Retina MacBook Pro (Mid 2014). I also have a Google Pixel, a Raspberry
Pi, and an iPad Pro 9.7 inch.

I was homeschooled through high school, but I also attended Red Rocks Community
College doing a few classes a semester through high school. I also worked at
Can/Am Technologies, Inc. as a software developer during high school. I
developed on a full web development stack: JS (ExtJS), C# .NET, Oracle PL/SQL.
(See my [portfolio]({filename}/pages/portfolio.html) for more info).

When I'm not doing school, I enjoy playing soccer and volleyball. I also used to
practice TaeKwonDo regularly, but I have not had enough time since I started
college. While I did TaeKwonDo, I achieved my 3rd Degree Black Belt.

This site is the place to get updates on my life. I maintain a [blog](/) here
where I post occasionally. I post about my travels, technology, politics, etc.
On my portfolio page, I have an up-to-date overview of [my professional
achievements]({filename}/pages/portfolio.html). I also have an always-up-to-date
link to my [resume]({filename}/static/resume.pdf). You can also find links to
all of my social media accounts from this site.

Happy reading!
