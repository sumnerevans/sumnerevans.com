title: About

Hello, welcome to my website! I am so glad you stopped by to check it out!

Let me introduce myself. My name is Sumner, I am 19 years old and live in
Denver, Colorado. I am a Senior in Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines.
After I graduate, I am going to stay at Mines to complete a Masters Degree in
Computer Science through the five-year masters degree program.

Computers are my passion. I really enjoy programming and the computer science
courses I've taken so far at Mines have been very interesting. I run Arch Linux
on my 15" Retina MacBook Pro (Mid 2014). I also have an iPhone 5s, a Raspberry
Pi, and an iPad Pro 9.7 inch.

I was homeschooled through high school, but I also attended Red Rocks Community
College doing a few classes a semester through high school. I also worked at
Can/Am Technologies, Inc. as a software developer during high school. I
developed on a full web development stack: JS (ExtJS), C# .NET, Oracle PL/SQL.
(See my portfolio for more info).

When I'm not doing school, I enjoy playing soccer and I am a 3rd Degree Black
Belt in ATA TaeKwonDo.

This site is the place to get updates on my life. I maintain a blog here where I
post occasionally. I post about my travels, technology, politics, etc. On my
portfolio page, I have an up-to-date overview of my professional achievements. I
also have an always-up-to-date link to my resume. You can also find links to all
of my social media accounts from this site.

Happy Reading!!!
