Hello, welcome to my website! I am so glad you stopped by to check it out!

Let me introduce myself. My name is Sumner, I am 21 years old and live in
Denver, Colorado. I am a Software Engineer at `The Trade Desk`_. I graduated
with my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Colorado School of Mines
in May 2018 and then graduated with my masters degree in Computer Science from
Mines in May 2019.

Computers are my passion. I really enjoy programming and the computer science
courses I took at Mines have been very interesting. Now that I have a job, I'm
really excited to be able to apply my knowledge of programming in an industry
situation. I have a list of all my gear `here <gear_>`_.

I was homeschooled through high school, but I also attended Red Rocks Community
College doing a few classes a semester during high school. I also worked at
`Can/Am Technologies, Inc. <canam_>`_ as a software developer during high school.  (See my
`portfolio`_ for more info).

When I'm not working, I enjoy playing soccer, volleyball, and I've been getting
into racquetball lately. During high school, I won the FRCCA State Championship
with Denver Eagles my senior year. I also used to practice TaeKwonDo regularly,
but I have not had enough time since I started college.  While I did TaeKwonDo,
I achieved my 3rd Degree Black Belt.

This site is the place to get updates on my life. I maintain a `blog`_ here
where I post occasionally. I post about my travels, technology, politics, etc.
On my portfolio page, I have an up-to-date overview of `my professional
achievements <portfolio_>`_. I also have an always-up-to-date link to my
`resume`_. You can also find links to all of my social media accounts from this
site.
