Security
--------

I prefer E2E encrypted DMs in Matrix.

I use my GPG key for signing git commits, git tags, and emails. If you have a
GPG key and would like me to encrypt my email messages to you, please let me
know.

There are a variety of ways that you can get my GPG key to verify my commits and
emails. Here are a few:

* **Keybase:** I'm jsve_ on Keybase.
* **PGP Keyservers:** You can find my `key on a keyserver <keyserver_>`_. Just
  search for my email. I recommend using http://keys.gnupg.net because the MIT
  one is overloaded all the time it seems.

My full GPG Key ID is::

    3F15 C22B FD12 5095 F9C0 7275 8904 527A B500 22FD
