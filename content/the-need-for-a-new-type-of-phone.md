Currently, there are only two kinds of phones. Smartphones and dumb
phones. I don't think that these terms are descriptive enough. Take, for
example, the iPhone versus the \$14.99 flip phone you can get at
Walmart. Obviously, the iPhone is a smartphone and the flip phone is a
dumb phone. Now take a phone in the middle of the pack maybe one with a
slide-out keyboard but no internet. Where does it fit? Does it qualify
as a smart phone? Or is it a kinda-dumb smartphone? Well, my opinion is
that that is a dumb phone. Where, then, does the little flip phone come
in? Does it get put into the dumb phone category with the phone with the
slide-out keyboard? No way! It is a much dumber phone. But that still
doesn't answer the question. Where does it get placed on the ladder of
phone categories? Let me propose a new rung on the ladder. A *very* low
rung...Â Introducing... The idiot phone. Yes, the idiot phone. With this
new phone categorization, the problem of how to categorize a flip phone
is solved.
