Today we were at sea. I didn't wake up until late morning, having been up late
the last night being miserable because of New Years celebrations.

I spent the day (or what was left of it) swimming, playing ping-pong, and
soccer.

Dinner was as usual and we went to play trivia after the show. The assistant
cruise director, Alia, runs the trivia and she makes it really fun. She's even
learned my name from the ping-pong tournaments! We've been going to trivia when
we can, I normally get one or two of the questions, but most of it is about the
Beatles and other things that old people know about.

After trivia we went to the show. It was a family-friendly comedian. He did a
combination of improv comedy talking to the audience and normal standup,
situational, and shared-experience comedy. It was really funny.
