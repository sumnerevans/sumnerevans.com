Today we were at sea. I woke up really late today: 10:00 late. After breakfast,
I went played some soccer on the sports court for about two hours. Then I ate
lunch and went for a really quick swim (I didn't stay long since there were
about 50 people around the pool drinking so it wasn't much fun). I then grabbed
my iPad and caught up on my blog writing. After that I went down to trivia. I
contributed a few answers so I felt smart. I showered and then we ate dinner.
After that we went to a comedy improv show and then to the normal show.
