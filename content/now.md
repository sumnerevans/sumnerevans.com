I recently accepted a new position as a Senior Implementation Tech Lead at
[Can/Am Technologies](https://canamtechnologies.com/) and I'm working in Denver
West. I'm learning as I go, but I'm enjoying the new challenges that technical
leadership entails.

I joined a men's indoor soccer league recently with a couple of friends from
high school.

I stopped teaching at Mines as a side-gig because the administration was
treating me very poorly, and with my new position I have less flexibility to
teach. I've been helping teach more at my taekwondo school lately instead.
