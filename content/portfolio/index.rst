**MLocate** -- February 2019
  This project won *Second Place* at `HackCU V <hackcu_>`_.

  Read my blog post about this hackathon:
  `HackCU V <{{< ref "/posts/hackathons/hackcu-v" >}}>`_


  MLocate is a comprehensive system for tracking and locating devices within an
  indoor space just using Wi-Fi ping signals. Using three specially configured
  Wi-Fi access points, we were able to capture signal strength from every device
  in the room by MAC address. Then, applying Radio Signal Strength Indication
  (RSSI) models, we were able to derive distance from signal strength which
  allowed us to use standard triangulation algorithms for determining the
  location of all of every device in the room.

  I worked on the triangulation logic for pinpointing device locations given
  distances calculated from signal strength. I also built the web frontend for
  displaying device locations.

  MLocate was a hackathon project by `Ben Perkins`_, `Jesus Nuñez`_, `Nick
  Jarmusz`_, (all freshmen) and myself. We developed it during a 24 hour period
  at the `HackCU V <hackcu_>`_ hackathon.

.. _project-hypar-map:

**HypAR Map** -- November 2018
  This project won *First Place* at the Facebook Global Hackathon Finals at
  Facebook HQ.

  The Competition <fbblog_>`_.

  .. _fbblog: {{< ref "/posts/hackathons/2018-11-16-facebook-hackathon-the-competition" >}}

  HypAR Map helps users navigate around unfamiliar locations by overlaying a map
  of the area using augmented reality. The map can come from any photo (for
  example, a fire escape plan) and is calibrated using an intuitive user
  interface. HypAR Map then uses simultaneous location and mapping to find and
  display the location of the user in the map in real-time.

  I worked on the image import functionality and worked with all of the members
  of the team to ensure that everything connected properly.

  HypAR Map was a hackathon project by `Sam Sartor`_, `Jack Garner`_, `Fisher
  Darling`_, and myself. We developed it during a 24 hour period at the Facebook
  Global Hackathon Finals at Facebook HQ in Menlo Park, CA.

  This project won *Best Use of GCP* and the *Facebook Best Social Good Hack*
  awards at MHacks_.

  Datanium is a large-scale network of Raspberry Pis which allow for
  human-powered transfer of data between places with internet access and places
  which do not. In the Datanium ecosystem, there are two different types of
  users: consumers and couriers. Consumers request data, and Datanium ensures
  that couriers move the requested data to the Datanium Node closest to the
  consuming user. Datanium does this coordination using only SMS.

  I worked on the web frontend for requesting and uploading data to the Datanium
  nodes.

  Datanium was a hackathon project by `Sam Sartor`_, `Robby Zampino`_, `Fisher
  Darling`_, and myself. We developed it during a 36 hour period at the `MHacks
  2018 <mhacks_>`_ hackathon.

  sponsor challenge at `HackCU IV <hackcu_>`_.

  Wii-Track is a distributed inventory tracking system. It utilizes a WiiFit,
  Rasberry Pi, and Arduino to gather information about packages. All heavy
  computation is done on AWS Lambda and it uses the DynamoDB NoSQL database as a
  backend.

  I worked on setting up the DynamoDB database and implemented a AWS Lambda
  function to identify packages by weight.

  Wii-Track was a hackathon project by `David Florness`_, `Jack Garner`_, `Robby
  Zampino`_, and myself. We developed it during a 24 hour period at the `HackCU
  IV <hackcu_>`_ hackathon.

  This project won the *Grand Prize* at the 2017 Xilinx PYNQ Hackathon.

  Parqyng Lots tracks the number of cars in an arbitrary number of parking lots
  with an arbitrary number of entrances to create an up-to-date picture of the
  parking situation.

  I built the web frontend which provided a view of the parking lots' status.

  Our team consisted of `Sam Sartor`_, `Jack Rosenthal`_, `Daichi Jameson`_, and
  myself. I worked on the web interface and also helped implement the tracking
  system using the sensors provided by Xilinx.
