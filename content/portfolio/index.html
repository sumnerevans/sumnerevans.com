|visplay|_ -- February 2018 - May 2020
  Visplay is a Mines ACM project. It's goal is to create a digital signage
  system with a dynamic, hierarchical configuration system which can be used in
  a wide variety of hardware and infrastructure configurations.

  I worked on the initial design of the overall architecture of the project. I
  have also contributed in a project management role. I worked on the Python
  components of the project which consume the configuration files and generate
  playlists. I also led development of the web configuration frontend.

  Currently, I am working in an advisory role as an industry project mentor.

|mlocate|_ -- February 2019
  This project won *Second Place* at `HackCU V <hackcu_>`_.

  Read my blog post about this hackathon:
  `HackCU V <{{< ref "/posts/hackathons/hackcu-v" >}}>`_

  MLocate is a comprehensive system for tracking and locating devices within an
  indoor space just using Wi-Fi ping signals. Using three specially configured
  Wi-Fi access points, we were able to capture signal strength from every device
  in the room by MAC address. Then, applying Radio Signal Strength Indication
  (RSSI) models, we were able to derive distance from signal strength which
  allowed us to use standard triangulation algorithms for determining the
  location of all of every device in the room.

  I worked on the triangulation logic for pinpointing device locations given
  distances calculated from signal strength. I also built the web frontend for
  displaying device locations.

  MLocate was a hackathon project by `Ben Perkins`_, `Jesus Nuñez`_, `Nick
  Jarmusz`_, (all freshmen) and myself. We developed it during a 24 hour period
  at the `HackCU V <hackcu_>`_ hackathon.

.. _project-hypar-map:

|hyparmap|_ -- November 2018
  This project won *First Place* at the Facebook Global Hackathon Finals at
  Facebook HQ.

  Read my blog post about this hackathon: `Facebook Global Hackathon Finals -
  The Competition <fbblog_>`_.

  HypAR Map helps users navigate around unfamiliar locations by overlaying a map
  of the area using augmented reality. The map can come from any photo (for
  example, a fire escape plan) and is calibrated using an intuitive user
  interface. HypAR Map then uses simultaneous location and mapping to find and
  display the location of the user in the map in real-time.

  I worked on the image import functionality and worked with all of the members
  of the team to ensure that everything connected properly.

  HypAR Map was a hackathon project by `Sam Sartor`_, `Jack Garner`_, `Fisher
  Darling`_, and myself. We developed it during a 24 hour period at the Facebook
  Global Hackathon Finals at Facebook HQ in Menlo Park, CA.

.. _project-datanium:

|datanium|_ -- October 2018
  This project won *Best Use of GCP* and the *Facebook Best Social Good Hack*
  awards at MHacks_.

  Datanium is a large-scale network of Raspberry Pis which allow for
  human-powered transfer of data between places with internet access and places
  which do not. In the Datanium ecosystem, there are two different types of
  users: consumers and couriers. Consumers request data, and Datanium ensures
  that couriers move the requested data to the Datanium Node closest to the
  consuming user. Datanium does this coordination using only SMS.

  I worked on the web frontend for requesting and uploading data to the Datanium
  nodes.

  Datanium was a hackathon project by `Sam Sartor`_, `Robby Zampino`_, `Fisher
  Darling`_, and myself. We developed it during a 36 hour period at the `MHacks
  2018 <mhacks_>`_ hackathon.

.. _project-wii-track:

|wiitrack|_ -- February 2018
  This project won *Judges Favorite*, *Best Use of AWS*, and the *Dish Network*
  sponsor challenge at `HackCU IV <hackcu_>`_.

  Wii-Track is a distributed inventory tracking system. It utilizes a WiiFit,
  Rasberry Pi, and Arduino to gather information about packages. All heavy
  computation is done on AWS Lambda and it uses the DynamoDB NoSQL database as a
  backend.

  I worked on setting up the DynamoDB database and implemented a AWS Lambda
  function to identify packages by weight.

  Wii-Track was a hackathon project by `David Florness`_, `Jack Garner`_, `Robby
  Zampino`_, and myself. We developed it during a 24 hour period at the `HackCU
  IV <hackcu_>`_ hackathon.

|blockmrs|_ -- January 2018
  BlockMRS is a privacy concious, decentralized, blockchain-backed, medical
  record system for the 21st Century. It stores patient records in IPFS using
  asymmetric encryption giving patients control over their health data.

  I led the development of the protocol specification for this decentralized
  system. I also built the system for storing encrypted medical records in IPFS.

  BlockMRS was a hackathon project by `David Florness`_, `Jack Rosenthal`_,
  `Robby Zampino`_, and myself. We developed it during a 24 hour period at the
  `MinneHack 2018 <minnehack_>`_ hackathon.

  This was the final project from my independent study in Virtual Reality under
  the supervision of Dr. Paone. Our team consisted of `Sam Sartor`_, `Robbie
  Merillat`_, and myself.

  We created our own library called ``flight`` for developing VR applications
  which implemented a new type of program architecture called Deferred Immediate
  Mode.

|parqyng|_ -- October 2017
  This project won the *Grand Prize* at the 2017 Xilinx PYNQ Hackathon.

  Parqyng Lots tracks the number of cars in an arbitrary number of parking lots
  with an arbitrary number of entrances to create an up-to-date picture of the
  parking situation.

  I built the web frontend which provided a view of the parking lots' status.

  Our team consisted of `Sam Sartor`_, `Jack Rosenthal`_, `Daichi Jameson`_, and
  myself. I worked on the web interface and also helped implement the tracking
  system using the sensors provided by Xilinx.

.. _project-wireless-debugging:

|widb|_ -- May 2017 - June 2017
  Wireless Debugging is a mobile SDK and sample web server for streaming mobile
  app logs to a web UI console. I worked on this project on a team of five CS
  students during Mines Computer Science Field Session. This project was done
  under supervision of Google.

  We designed and built a mobile API, log parsing library, datastore interface,
  user management interface, and web app. I was the primary writer of the API
  Specification for communicating between each component. I also built the log
  parsing library and the mobile API implementation for iOS. I was involved in
  the development of the other components as well.

|chesspp|_ -- August 2016
  Chess++ was my final project for CSCI 261 at Colorado School of Mines during
  the Summer II Semester of 2016.

  Chess++ allows two players to play a standard Chess game against one another
  on the computer.

|snowflakes|_ -- November 2016
  See a `live demo <https://sumnerevans.github.io/snowflakes/>`_.

  Snowflakes is an interactive "screensaver" built for the Mines ACM JavaScript
  Hackathon.

  I built Snowflakes with **bungle.js**, a team consisting of `Sam Sartor`_,
  `Jack Rosenthal`_, and myself. We used EaselJS to manipulate a fullscreen
  canvas to render the interactive elements.

|qs|_ -- September 2016
  See a `live demo <https://qs.sumnerevans.com/>`__.

  Quadratic Solver solves quadratic equations and shows the steps required to
  get the answer.

  Quadratic Solver uses `MathJax <https://www.mathjax.org/>`_ to display
  beautifully formatted solutions to quadratic equations.

Publications
============

.. _publication-dreams-of-flight:

|claro|_ -- Fall 2013
  I wrote this creative writing piece about Orville and Wilbur Wright and the
  first flight at Kitty Hawk for my Twentieth Century World History class in
  Fall 2013. I had written this piece for an assignment called *A Picture is
  Worth a Thousand Words*. We were tasked with writing an approximately 1000
  word narrative from the perspective of a person in a significant photo from
  the 20th Century. Later in 2013 I was published in the |claro2013|_, Red Rocks
  Community College's Interdisciplinary Scholarly Journal. In May 2014, I
  `presented at the CLARO academic conference
  <presentation-dreams-of-flight_>`_.

=============

|openstandards|_ -- November 2019
  I gave this presentation at the Mines Linux Users Group with `Robby Zampino`_.
  We discussed what standards exist, and why open standards are better than
  closed ones. We also gave a few examples of different open standards in many
  different industries.
