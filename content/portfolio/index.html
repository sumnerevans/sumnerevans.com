      I worked on building the infrastructure necessary to connect people on every chat network through
      <b>Matrix</b>. I worked mainly on bridges and other backend projects to enable Beeper to grow
      and add new users.
    </p>
    <details open>
      <summary>Notable projects include...</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Scaled our backend infrastructure from handling &lt;1,000 users to &gt;100,000 users by
          <b>sharding</b> traffic from high-volume bridges to a separate <b>Go</b> service called
          <a href="#presentation-hungryserv">Hungryserv</a> in a backwards-compatible, transparent
          manner. I created the initial proof of concept and then continued as a core member of
          the 3-member team that productionized the project over a four-month period.
        </li>
        <li>
          Saved ~2TB of RAM by rewriting the
          <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/telegramgo" target="_blank">Telegram<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
          to <b>Matrix</b> bridge from Python to <b>Go</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reverse-engineered</b> and implemented features for
          <a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/introducing-beeper-mini-get-blue" target="_blank">Beeper Mini<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
          (iMessage on Android) including media, tapbacks, typing indicators, read receipts,
          edits, unsends, link previews, and chat metadata changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented the cryptographic key infrastructure necessary for message
          <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/go/tree/main/crypto/backup" target="_blank">key backups<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>

          by utilizing the standard Go <b>cryptography libraries</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented media upload/download and interactive device verification in the Beeper
          client SDK written in <b>Go</b> which is being used in the next generation Beeper clients.
        </li>
        <li>
          Measured message send <b>latency and reliability</b> by instrumenting bridge
          <b>metrics</b>. Built a Dockerized <b>Go</b> service to process those metrics and send
          them to BigQuery.
        </li>
        <li>
          Streamlined our support team's ability to chat directly with users by
          building a
          <a href="https://github.com/beeper/chatwoot/" target="_blank">Chatwoot bot<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
          in <b>Go</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reverse-engineered</b> the LinkedIn Messaging API and implemented a
          <a href="https://github.com/beeper/linkedin" target="_blank">LinkedIn<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
          to Matrix bridge in <b>Python</b> and later in <b>Go</b>.

    <p>
      I have had the opportunity to teach courses in multiple areas of computer science at my alma
      mater, Colorado School of Mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courses I've taught:
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>
        <b>Algorithms (4&times;)</b> &mdash;
        advanced data structures, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, NP-completeness
      </summary>
      <p>
        I taught <i>CSCI 406 Algorithms</i> once while I was a graduate student in 2018 under
        <a href="http://inside.mines.edu/~dmehta/" target="_blank">Dr. Dinesh Mehta<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
        I also taught two sections in Spring 2022 using Dr. Mehta's materials. I co-taught the
        class with Dr. Mehta in Fall 2023 and Fall 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        Full list of topics that the class covers include: analysis of algorithms, advanced data
        structures, sorting algorithms, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and NP-completeness.

        functional programming, parsers, type systems, formal semantics
      </summary>
      <p>
        I taught <i>CSCI 400 Principles of Programming Languages</i> once as a graduate student in
        2019. Topics that the class covered at that time include: programming language concepts,
        evaluation, and implementation; object-oriented programming; Lambda Calculus; and Racket
        (a LISP dialect).
      </p>
      <p>
        I then taught the course twice under
        <a href="https://jrmcclurg.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Jedidiah McClurg<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
        in 2020 and 2021, and once under
        <a href="https://cs.mines.edu/project/read-amelia/" target="_blank">Amelia Read<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
        in Fall 2022. Topics that the course covered in those iterations included:
        functional programming concepts, type inference, OCaml, programming language
        implementation, and formal semantics.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>

        I taught <i>CSCI 564 Advanced Computer Architecture</i> in Spring of 2021. Topics that the
        class covered included: performance analysis, cache, virtual memory, pipelining, branch
        prediction, out-of-order execution, and multiprocessors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I based the course off of the curriculum provided by
        <a href="http://inside.mines.edu/~bwu/" target="_blank">Dr. Bo Wu<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
        and adapted it for hybrid COVID learning. The main additions/changes were adding lecture
        worksheets to improve student engagement in lectures, modernizing the slides, and reworking
        the projects starter code to better focus on the learning objectives.

      I gave this presentation at the 2024 Matrix Conference.
      I discussed the cryptographic key infrastructure in Matrix,
      that is all of the features which support key sharing and identity verification,
      but don't actually themselves provide message security.

        We covered the background and history of filesystems and some current filesystems used in
        Linux, Windows, and macOS. We also covered some more fringe filesystems like Btrfs and ZFS and
        network filesystems such as Samba and sshfs as well as virtual filesystems such as
        <code>/proc</code>.

      Tracktime is a filesystem-backed time tracking solution with a command line interface. It uses
      a sane directory structure to organize CSV files that store time tracking data for each day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracktime allows you to start, stop, resume, and list time entries for a given day. You can
      also generate reports for a given month in the reStructuredText, PDF, or HTML formats
      (optionally restricted to a particular customer).  Tracktime also allows you to synchronise
      the time spent on each issue/merge request to GitLab using the GitLab Time Tracking API.

      infrastructure configurations.

      MLocate is a comprehensive system for tracking and locating devices within an indoor space
      just using Wi-Fi ping signals. Using three specially configured Wi-Fi access points, we were
      able to capture signal strength from every device in the room by MAC address. Then, applying
      Radio Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) models, we were able to derive distance from signal
      strength which allowed us to use standard triangulation algorithms for determining the
      location of all of every device in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on the triangulation logic for pinpointing device locations given distances
      calculated from signal strength. I also built the web frontend for displaying device
      locations.

      HypAR Map helps users navigate around unfamiliar locations by overlaying a map of the area
      using augmented reality. The map can come from any photo (for example, a fire escape plan) and
      is calibrated using an intuitive user interface. HypAR Map then uses simultaneous location and
      mapping to find and display the location of the user in the map in real-time.

        Datanium is a large-scale network of Raspberry Pis which allow for human-powered transfer of
        data between places with internet access and places which do not. In the Datanium ecosystem,
        there are two different types of users: consumers and couriers. Consumers request data, and
        Datanium ensures that couriers move the requested data to the Datanium Node closest to the
        consuming user. Datanium does this coordination using only SMS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked on the web frontend for requesting and uploading data to the Datanium nodes.

        Wii-Track is a distributed inventory tracking system. It utilizes a WiiFit, Rasberry Pi,
        and Arduino to gather information about packages. All heavy computation is done on AWS
        Lambda and it uses the DynamoDB NoSQL database as a backend.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked on setting up the DynamoDB database and implemented a AWS Lambda function to
        identify packages by weight.

        BlockMRS is a privacy concious, decentralized, blockchain-backed, medical record system for
        the 21st Century. It stores patient records in IPFS using asymmetric encryption giving
        patients control over their health data.
