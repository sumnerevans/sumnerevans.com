    <p>
      <tt>offlinemsmtp</tt> allows you to use the <tt>msmtp</tt> SMTP email sending program offline.
      While offline, it enqueues emails to be sent once an internet connection is established. While
      online, it sends the emails immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>offlinemsmtp</tt> is written in Python, and is available via
      <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/offlinemsmtp/">PyPi</a>
      and on the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/offlinemsmtp/">AUR</a>.

      Visplay is a Mines ACM project. It's goal is to create a digital signage system with a
      dynamic, hierarchical configuration system which can be used in a wide variety of hardware and
      infrastructure configurations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on the initial design of the overall architecture of the project. I have also
      contributed in a project management role. I worked on the Python components of the project
      which consume the configuration files and generate playlists. I also led development of the
      web configuration frontend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am working in an advisory role as an industry project mentor.

      MLocate is a comprehensive system for tracking and locating devices within an indoor space
      just using Wi-Fi ping signals. Using three specially configured Wi-Fi access points, we were
      able to capture signal strength from every device in the room by MAC address. Then, applying
      Radio Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) models, we were able to derive distance from signal
      strength which allowed us to use standard triangulation algorithms for determining the
      location of all of every device in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on the triangulation logic for pinpointing device locations given distances
      calculated from signal strength. I also built the web frontend for displaying device
      locations.

      HypAR Map helps users navigate around unfamiliar locations by overlaying a map of the area
      using augmented reality. The map can come from any photo (for example, a fire escape plan) and

      mapping to find and display the location of the user in the map in real-time.

      Datanium is a large-scale network of Raspberry Pis which allow for human-powered transfer of
      data between places with internet access and places which do not. In the Datanium ecosystem,
      there are two different types of users: consumers and couriers. Consumers request data, and
      Datanium ensures that couriers move the requested data to the Datanium Node closest to the
      consuming user. Datanium does this coordination using only SMS.
