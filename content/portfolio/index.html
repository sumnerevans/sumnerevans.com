      MLocate is a comprehensive system for tracking and locating devices within an indoor space
      just using Wi-Fi ping signals. Using three specially configured Wi-Fi access points, we were
      able to capture signal strength from every device in the room by MAC address. Then, applying
      Radio Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) models, we were able to derive distance from signal
      strength which allowed us to use standard triangulation algorithms for determining the
      location of all of every device in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on the triangulation logic for pinpointing device locations given distances
      calculated from signal strength. I also built the web frontend for displaying device
      locations.

      HypAR Map helps users navigate around unfamiliar locations by overlaying a map of the area
      using augmented reality. The map can come from any photo (for example, a fire escape plan) and

      Datanium is a large-scale network of Raspberry Pis which allow for human-powered transfer of
      data between places with internet access and places which do not. In the Datanium ecosystem,
      there are two different types of users: consumers and couriers. Consumers request data, and
      Datanium ensures that couriers move the requested data to the Datanium Node closest to the
      consuming user. Datanium does this coordination using only SMS.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on the web frontend for requesting and uploading data to the Datanium nodes.

      Wii-Track is a distributed inventory tracking system. It utilizes a WiiFit, Rasberry Pi,
      and Arduino to gather information about packages. All heavy computation is done on AWS
      Lambda and it uses the DynamoDB NoSQL database as a backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on setting up the DynamoDB database and implemented a AWS Lambda function to

|vrfp|_ -- August 2017 - December 2017
  Read our `final report on GitHub <vr-report_>`_.

  This was the final project from my independent study in Virtual Reality under
  the supervision of Dr. Paone. Our team consisted of `Sam Sartor`_, `Robbie
  Merillat`_, and myself.

  We created our own library called ``flight`` for developing VR applications
  which implemented a new type of program architecture called Deferred Immediate
  Mode.

.. _project-parqyng-lots:

|parqyng|_ -- October 2017
  This project won the *Grand Prize* at the 2017 Xilinx PYNQ Hackathon.

  Parqyng Lots tracks the number of cars in an arbitrary number of parking lots
  with an arbitrary number of entrances to create an up-to-date picture of the
  parking situation.

  I built the web frontend which provided a view of the parking lots' status.

  Our team consisted of `Sam Sartor`_, `Jack Rosenthal`_, `Daichi Jameson`_, and
  myself. I worked on the web interface and also helped implement the tracking
  system using the sensors provided by Xilinx.

.. _project-wireless-debugging:

|widb|_ -- May 2017 - June 2017
  Wireless Debugging is a mobile SDK and sample web server for streaming mobile
  app logs to a web UI console. I worked on this project on a team of five CS
  students during Mines Computer Science Field Session. This project was done
  under supervision of Google.

  We designed and built a mobile API, log parsing library, datastore interface,
  user management interface, and web app. I was the primary writer of the API
  Specification for communicating between each component. I also built the log
  parsing library and the mobile API implementation for iOS. I was involved in
  the development of the other components as well.

  Snowflakes is an interactive "screensaver" built for the Mines ACM JavaScript
  Hackathon.

  I built Snowflakes with **bungle.js**, a team consisting of `Sam Sartor`_,
  `Jack Rosenthal`_, and myself. We used EaselJS to manipulate a fullscreen
  canvas to render the interactive elements.

Publications
============

.. _publication-dreams-of-flight:

|claro|_ -- Fall 2013
  I wrote this creative writing piece about Orville and Wilbur Wright and the
  first flight at Kitty Hawk for my Twentieth Century World History class in
  Fall 2013. I had written this piece for an assignment called *A Picture is
  Worth a Thousand Words*. We were tasked with writing an approximately 1000
  word narrative from the perspective of a person in a significant photo from
  the 20th Century. Later in 2013 I was published in the |claro2013|_, Red Rocks
  Community College's Interdisciplinary Scholarly Journal. In May 2014, I
  `presented at the CLARO academic conference
  <presentation-dreams-of-flight_>`_.
