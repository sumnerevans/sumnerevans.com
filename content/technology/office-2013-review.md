A little while ago I downloaded and installed [Office
2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2013 "Microsoft Office 2013"){.zem_slink}
Preview on my
[PC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"){.zem_slink}.
Now, with only a few days before the final version shows up in stores I
decided to post some of my thoughts on it.

1.  ### Files First

    When you open Word, you immediately see your
    [files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file "Computer file"){.zem_slink}.\[/caption\]

    <p>
    The first thing that I noticed about Office 2013 is that it puts
    your files first.<!--more--> On run, Word,
    [PowerPoint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint "Microsoft PowerPoint"){.zem_slink},
    Publisher, and Access all open to a page with recent files, and a
    view of all the templates that you can use to create a new
    document/file. (See picture)

2.  ### SkyDrive Integration

    One feature that is *really* cool is SkyDrive integration.
    Basically, Microsoft has hard-coded SkyDrive into Office 2013.This
    is great because you don't actually have to have the file on your
    local device/computer. (I use the SkyDrive desktop app and so all of
    my files sync anyway but if I had, for example, a [Surface
    tablet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface "Microsoft Surface"){.zem_slink}
    I wouldn't have to have all of my files stored on it.)

    <p>
    For those of you who are wondering "What in the world is SkyDrive?"
    it is basically
    [Microsoft's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft"){.zem_slink}
    version of [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com "Dropbox"){.zem_slink}.
    You can store your files on your personal SkyDrive. You get 7GB to
    start and can buy more space if you want. If you buy [Office
    365](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_365 "Microsoft Office 365"){.zem_slink}
    you get 20GB more space (for a total of 27GB).

3.  ### Smooth Cursor

    <p>
    One of the coolest aesthetic improvements to Office is the smooth
    cursor. Rather than moving instantly to a new position as you type,
    the new cursor glides along the page as you enter text. You may
    think that it shouldn't matter that much but when you see it you get
    addicted to it immediately. I love it! It looks great in Excel as
    well. You can actually see the selection of a cell move!

4.  ### The Ribbon

    <p>
    Love it or hate it, you have to have it and you may as well learn
    how to use it because pretty soon everything will be using it.
    ([File
    Explorer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer "File Explorer"){.zem_slink}
    has already made the transition.) Personally, it is a nice
    interface. It is clean and shows you only the stuff that you need.
    It's also easy to find the feature that you want because they are
    categorized in the little tabs.

You might be wondering if you should upgrade. If you are, my advice to
you is if you have the money, do it. If you don't, don't. (I know,
profound but hey it is true you can't buy anything without money.) Here
is a little chart to determine if you should upgrade.

I Currently Have...You Should...

  Nothing                                                                                                 Go out and buy it wen it comes out
  Office Pre-2003                                                                                         Get out of the stone ages!!! :) Go ahead. It's worth the investment.
  Office 2003                                                                                             Step into the twenty-teens. Buy it. It's time to upgrade.
  [Office 2007](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2007 "Microsoft Office 2007"){.zem_slink}   You're stuck with the ribbon already. You may as well upgrade because you will get more features and a "File" menu.
  Office 2010                                                                                             I would, but it isn't totally necessary
