**Somewhere over Northern Canada:** I am in the plane right now and just
got caught up on all my blog posts. Transportation to the airport was
fairly easy. The man who took us to the apartments yesterday took us to
the bus terminal where we caught an airport shuttle to Keflavik
International. Unfortunately, our flight was delayed an hour because the
plane was delayed arriving. We walked around the shops and ate lunch
just to kill time. We also bought food for the plane. We have a driver
set up to pick us up from Denver International Airport so I’ll assume
that that will work out fine.

Right now we are flying over northern Canada. We flew over some of
Greenland on the way and now we are approaching the Hudson Bay. It was a
great way to see the terrain of Greenland. Even one of the flight
attendants thought it was cool (normally the ground is obscured by
clouds). The middle of Greenland is basically one huge glacier. It was
very impressive, all I could see out of the window was white up to the
horizon in all directions (some of the white was clouds, but not much of
it). I’ll post some pictures of the terrain here.

We just passed over Bismarck, North Dakota, USA. It’s been really
turbulent all the way across the Canadian plains. The seatbelt sign has
been on basically since we reached mainland Canada. Thanks a lot
Canadians. They are coming through with drinks now that the turbulence
has stopped. I’m pretty sure that’s the most turbulence I’ve ever been
in (or at least that I can remember).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s been a hectic trip, but it was totally worth it. I’ll be posting
some reflections on the trip on my personal blog:
[sumnerevans.wordpress.com](https://sumnerevans.wordpress.com) so be
sure to check that out.

So with that I will conclude my discourse on the events of this trip. I
hope that you’ve all enjoyed reading and please do check out my
reflections on the trip. They’ll probably be profound.
