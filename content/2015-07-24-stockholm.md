We started this day very late. (I’m sure it had nothing to do with some
individuals sleeping in till 9:30… oh wait, that was me.) We ate
breakfast which luckily ran until 10:30 and then got ready to go.

We walked down to the central tram station and got on the 7 tram which
took us to our first destination: Scansen, an open air museum featuring
various Swedish buildings and animals. We started out by walking around
a reconstruction of a Swedish village around the 1840s. There was a
glass blowing shop, a woodworking shop, a factory, a few houses and a
school. One interesting thing about school during that period was that
the amount of light dictated the amount of school done because they only
used natural lighting. In one of the houses we went into, the guy said
that it was the house of a middle class family. There were only three
rooms in the house, but the room we were in was the one where you would
entertain guests. It had a piano, nice furniture, and wallpaper so that
you could make it look like you were wealthy , even if you really
weren’t. Things really haven’t changed much have they…

We continued on in the park seeing a bunch of different buildings and
exhibits. We eventually got to some animals. One of the sheep was baaing
really loudly as if to say “come pet me, come pet me”. We then wandered
up past more animal exhibits. I was rather tired at this point, and all
of the animals were apparently tired as well because we didn’t see any
in their exhibits.

We then went to have a late lunch. By that time it was probably around
15:00. Mom and I got terrible burgers with fries. Hannah just got the
fries. I am pretty sure McDonalds would have been better.

We probably only saw a half of Scansen which covers \~300,000 square
metres. But what we did see was very nice.

We then headed by tram to the Vasa Museum which was up the street a few
of blocks. The Vasa museum is a museum about a boat named the Vasa built
in 1628. 1000 metres into its maiden voyage, it sank. I would be able to
tell you more, but I was so tired during the explanatory movie that I
think I dozed off.

Three hundred thirty-three years later, the Vasa was raised from the
bottom of the ocean and the ship was preserved. The exhibits in the
museum explained everything about the boat from the preservation to the
sculptures to some of the people who died in the tragedy.

The boat itself was huge, from the bottom of the boat to the crows nest
was more than seven stories. The main deck itself was 4 stories high. We
weren’t able to go inside, but there were a bunch of exhibits explaining
various aspects of the boat. One interesting fact was that it weighted
as much as 3 jumbo jets.

On our way back to the hotel, we stopped to get some ice cream. I got
chocolate chip. Then we hopped on the tram to the center and walked to
the hotel. We went through the pedestrian mall that was really nice. It
was like 16th Street Mall in Denver. Then we grabbed a sandwich and ate
it in the park outside our hotel.
