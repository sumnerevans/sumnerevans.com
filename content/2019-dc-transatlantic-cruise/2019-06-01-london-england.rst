Today we docked in Southampton, England. I disembarked as early as possible so
that I could get in to London for as much of the day as possible. I did the
"self disembark" which basically just meant that I had to carry my bag off the
ship rather than have them take it for me. Mom is staying on the boat to go back
the other direction to NYC.

I took an Uber to the Southampton train station, and then I had to buy a ticket
to get into London. The trains don't leave that often from the station going
directly to London, and one was about to leave. I hadn't had a chance to convert
any currency, so I had to take a terrible exchange rate at the station. It cost
nearly $50 to get into London! Luckily, once I got on the train everything went
very smoothly, and I arrived in Victoria Station in London a couple hours later.

After I arrived in Victoria Station, I went straight to the hotel that I am
staying at: Chester Hotel Victoria. It's not a very nice hotel (it's 2 stars),
but the location is great. It was only a couple minutes walk from the station
once I had gotten my bearings. I was too early to check in, so I just left my
bags there so that I could go sight seeing.

I've been to London before, and I've been to most of the touristy locations. For
this trip, then I decided to focus on trying to experience London more. Of
course, one of the most Londonesque experiences is riding the Tube. We had,
utilized it when we were last here, but navigating it alone was a different
experience for sure. Since I am only here for a few days, I had to be somewhat
smart with what tickets I got. I figured that I would be riding it at least four
times today, and that was the price cutoff for buying individual tickets vs. the
day ticket. So, I grabbed a full day ticket, and headed off. I think I'll buy
individual tickets tomorrow, as I'll only be here for a few hours in the
morning.

First stop was the Tower of London, which isn't much of a tower... I didn't go
in, but I walked around it and then went across Tower Bridge.

The last
time I was here, we went inside of most of the sites, but this time I went 

I wanted to go around to all of the tourist spots along the Thames river.

, but I
wanted to explore the areas around them

- Got a day tube pass and
- went over to Tower of London and Tower Bridge

- Walked along the Thames looking for food (it was expensive!) until I got to a
  place where they had street vendors. Got fish and chips that were kinda
  crappy, but whatever

- Went across the bridge to St. Paul's, then hopped on the tube to go to
  the hotel and get ready to go to Evensong.

- Evensong was interesting, and got to walk inside of Westminster Abbey without
  the crowds (no pics, but whatever)

- on the way back, I went to a English pub and had a burger

- Went to bed
