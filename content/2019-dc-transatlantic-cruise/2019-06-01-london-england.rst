- got to Victoria for $50, ouch!
- arrived, went straight to the hotel to drop bags

- Got a day tube pass and
- went over to Tower of London and Tower Bridge

- Walked along the Thames looking for food (it was expensive!) until I got to a
  place where they had street vendors. Got fish and chips that were kinda
  crappy, but whatever

- Went across the bridge to St. Paul's, then hopped on the tube to go to
  the hotel and get ready to go to Evensong.

- Evensong was interesting, and got to walk inside of Westminster Abbey without
  the crowds (no pics, but whatever)

- on the way back, I went to a English pub and had a burger

- Went to bed
