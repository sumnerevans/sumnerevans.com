- Woke up, stored the bags, went to the supermarket nearby to get a little
  breakfast, then tube to Buckingham Palace.

- Tube to British Museum and walked around there looking at some of the things
  (look at pictures to remember what)

- tube back to Victoria station, and then grabbed bags from the hotel

- getting a train to Gatwick was fun, and kinda annoying, but got on, and
  everything was fine

- Flight was uneventful, I did get some good views of Greenland/Northern Canada
