Today is my last day of vacation. I flew back to Denver in the afternoon, and I
am starting my job at The Trade Desk on Monday which is just two days away! But,
that means that I had most of the morning to be in London. So, I decided to go
over to Buckingham Palace and then to the British Museum.

I really like Buckingham Palace, it's very magnificent and extravagant.

- Woke up, stored the bags, went to the supermarket nearby to get a little
  breakfast, then tube to Buckingham Palace.

- Tube to British Museum and walked around there looking at some of the things
  (look at pictures to remember what)

- tube back to Victoria station, and then grabbed bags from the hotel

- getting a train to Gatwick was fun, and kinda annoying, but got on, and
  everything was fine

- Flight was uneventful, I did get some good views of Greenland/Northern Canada
