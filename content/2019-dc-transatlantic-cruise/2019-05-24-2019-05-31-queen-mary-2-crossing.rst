Instead of giving you a day-by-day on what we did on the crossing (I was told
that it is *not* a cruise), I'm going to just talk about some of the highlights
and make some observations about my time on board the Queen Mary 2. We didn't
stop in any ports, so it was just what we did on board.

WWII Veteran Presentations
==========================

One of the main reasons we went on this cruise was because the *Greatest
Generation Foundation*, a group which helps tell the stories of WWII veterans,
was on board with 21 WWII veterans.

- Table mates were nice: engineers from Sweden (lived in USA for a long time)
  and England

- friends

  - Met chase on day 1
  - met Graham, Griffin, and Blake on day 2

    - workout session day 3?

  - Aaron on day 4 or so


- WWII veterans
- the nature of routine (it became routine what we did every day very quickly)
- First Man
