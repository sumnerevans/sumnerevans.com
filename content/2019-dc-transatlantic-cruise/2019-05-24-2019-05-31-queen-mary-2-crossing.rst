Instead of giving you a day-by-day on what we did on the crossing (I was told
that it is *not* a cruise), I'm going to just talk about some of the highlights
and make some observations about my time on board the Queen Mary 2. We didn't
stop in any ports, so it was just what we did on board.

WWII Veteran Presentations
==========================

One of the main reasons we went on this cruise was because the *Greatest
Generation Foundation*, a group which helps tell the stories of WWII veterans,
was on board with 21 WWII veterans. The Cunard Cruise Line and the Greatest
Generations foundation had coordinated events every morning where one or two of
the veterans were interviewed by a host and were able to tell their stories
about WWII. The host was a man from local television in Denver, so it was funny
seeing him in person.

The veterans' experiences spanned the entire war. One of the veterans was a
sailor on board one of the ships in Pearl Harbor on the December 7, 1941. His
ship was saved from capsizing due to the heroic work of some other 
He
escaped his ship by swimming to shore through water that was covered in burning
oil from ruptured fuel tanks.

Pearl Harbor to VE day


- Table mates were nice: engineers from Sweden (lived in USA for a long time)
  and England

- friends

  - Met chase on day 1
  - met Graham, Griffin, and Blake on day 2

    - workout session day 3?

  - Aaron on day 4 or so


- the nature of routine (it became routine what we did every day very quickly)
- First Man
