Instead of giving you a day-by-day on what we did on the crossing (I was told
that it is *not* a cruise because that's only lowly peasants would go on a
cruise), I'm going to just talk about some of the highlights and make some
observations about my time on board the Queen Mary 2. We didn't stop in any
ports, so it was just what we did on board.

WWII Veteran Presentations
==========================

One of the main reasons we went on this cruise was because the *Greatest
Generations Foundation*, a group which helps tell the stories of WWII veterans,
was on board with 21 WWII veterans. The Cunard Cruise Line and the Greatest
Generations foundation had coordinated events every morning where one or two of
the veterans were interviewed by a host and were able to tell their stories
about WWII. The host was a man from local television in Denver, so it was funny
seeing him in person. In addition to the host, there were a few Vietnam Veteran
"escorts" who helped the WWII veterans throughout the cruise.

The veterans' experiences spanned the entire war. One of the veterans was a
sailor on board one of the ships in Pearl Harbor on the December 7, 1941 while
another veteran was the radio operator in Eisenhower's war room on VE Day who
sent the message that Germany had surrendered to the allies.

The one who was there at Pearl Harbor, Stu, was on a ship that was hit by a
torpedo (maybe multiple torpedos, I don't remember exactly) and was rapidly
listing to that side. It was saved from capsizing due to the heroic work of some
sailors on another boat who tore holes on the other side of the boat so that it
sank straight down, rather than sideways. Stu escaped his ship by swimming to
shore through water that was covered in burning oil from ruptured fuel tanks.
He came up for breath once, in the middle of the inferno, and I remember him
clearly saying "that was the hottest breath of air I've ever taken".

A few of the veterans were captured and were held as prisoners of war, and one
one of the days they related their stories. On Memorial Day, which happened
during the cruise, they did a special session featuring the Vietnam Veterans
presenting the colours. Then, they had a special guest join one of the veterans.
General Matz, appointed by Donald Trump as the secretary of the American Battle
Monuments Commission, talked about the work that the Battle Monuments Commission
does to maintain the cemeteries, memorials, and monuments commemorating the
sacrifices of the U.S. Armed Forces overseas.

On the last day of the crossing, one of the veterans played his saxophone. I was
very impressed that he was able to do that, considering his age! They also had
all of the veterans up on stage at that time, and I got a picture.

Many of the veterans on board participated in the D-Day landings. In fact, many
of them are continuing on to the 75th Anniversary of D-Day commemorations that
are taking place in Normandy on June 6th of this year. Two of the veterans
parachuted into Normandy behind enemy lines on the night of June 5th, 1944.
Another two or three were part of the Navy and Marine corps that bombarded
Normandy, and took men onto the shores. I don't remember if any of them landed
on the shores or not. The unifying theme for all of them was that no Hollywood
movie does the horrors of war justice. *Saving Private Ryan* was mentioned many
times as being the closest approximation to the carnage. One of the veterans
said that the real thing was like "tak[ing] *Saving Private Ryan*, and mak[ing]
it ten times worse". Another one said that "the main omission was the body parts
strewn across the beach and in the water". Hearing their accounts gave me a much
greater appreciation for the slaughter that happened on the beaches of Normandy.

One of the veterans story was especially moving to me. It was Frank Divita, a
man from New York City. He had a distinct New York accent, and in another life
could have easily played the tough New York organized crime gangster in a movie
(or in real life, for that matter). But his tough guy appearance melted away
quickly when he began talking about his experiences in the war, specifically on
D-Day. He was a Marine on one of the landing craft (LCMs) that took men to the
shores on D-Day. His job was to lower the ramp to let the men out, but also let
the German machine gun bullets in. He had moved to this position after his
crewmate who was originally in that role had been killed. He talked about
hearing the bullets hitting the front of the craft and freezing when he was
supposed to lower the ramp. As soon as he lowered it, machine gun fire rained
in. The two men next to him were hit immediately. He related his fear that he
would be next. I think that Frank mentioned that one of the wounded beside him
actually survived, despite taking multiple bullets. The other one was fatally
wounded. As Frank talked about him, you could tell that he became very
emotional. He talked about how the man was really no more than a boy, maybe 18
or 19 years old. As the boy lay on the floor of the LCM, he cried out for his
mother. Frank said a prayer over him, and administered some morphine. "And
then,", said Frank, clearly having a hard time getting the words out, "he
died.". Watching this man, now in his 90s, who looked like your typical New York
City tough-guy, nearly breaking down as he described what had happened to him
three-quarters of a century ago was very impactful. I will never forget his
story.

Making Some New Friends
=======================

On a lighter note, I met a bunch of people and made some new friends. Mom and I
were at a table with two other couples. One was from England, and one was from
Sweden originally, but now live in California. The Swedish couple were heading
over for the summer to their home in Sweden, and the couple from England were
heading back home after having gone the other direction on the Queen Mary 2 last
week. Both of the men were retired engineers. It seemed like quite a few of the
people that we met were engineers, and mom and I decided that the reason for
that was that engineers tend to make enough money to live comfortably and go on
cruises, but not enough money to be in the large suites at the front of the boat
with their own, more exclusive dining room.

I was initially worried that I would be the only one on board under 45, but
luckily I was proven wrong almost immediately. Before we even left New York, I
met a guy named Chase who is also 21. He is headed to Spain for the summer for a
study abroad program. We hit it off immediately, since he was a history major,
and I love history.

The next day, I met three teenage guys at the ping-pong tournament. They were
cousins and were onboard with their grandma. Two of them, Graham and Griffin,
are heading in to their senior year of high school while the other, Blake, is
heading into his freshman year (I think) of high school. We ended up hanging out
quite a bit during the :strike:`cruise` crossing. That evening, there was a
Young Adults get-together. I met quite a few more young people at that event.
One of them was Ryan, who just graduated with a degree in computer science and
is going to start at Raytheon. Also there were two sisters, Gretchen and Meghan,
and Trueman, and two young businessmen, Richard and Jakub, with their manager
who had somehow convinced their company to pay for the cruise instead of
airfare.

I ran into another teenager, Aaron, on the third or forth day after going to a
movie showing. He was very glad to find somebody younger, and he ended up
hanging out with us some. There were a few other young people here and there,
but I didn't see much of them so they don't get a mention here (mainly because I
forgot their names...).

Overall, I enjoyed meeting all of those people and hanging out with them. It was
surprising how quickly we all fell into a routine. I think it's a testament to
the power of normalcy. Every day for me went something like this:

- Wake up right before the veterans presentation, and stumble into that at
  10:00.
- Go eat some breakfast/lunch, sometimes running into some friends.
- Go to the pool for a few hours (normally with Chase or the cousins), and
  potentially go to some lecture or other event.
- Play in the ping-pong tournament. I almost always was out in the first or
  second round. Graham was way better and won a couple of the tournaments.
- On a few of the days, Graham, Griffin, Blake, and I we went with their grandma
  to afternoon tea.
- Go to afternoon trivia in the Golden Lion Pub. (I am not good at trivia, but I
  pretend to know what I'm doing and make everyone else on my team answer the
  questions.)
- Maybe hop back in the pool for half an hour.
- Get ready for dinner and go eat.
- Go to Wipeout Trivia and get destroyed again.
- Go to the show, listen to live music somewhere, or otherwise hang out.
- Go to bed.

It was fairly busy, but also relaxing at the same time. There was enough of a
variety of activities that I was not bored. I was pretty proud of myself, I even
went to the gym once. I played a couple of games of chess, too. When I don't
blunder, I can hold my own against most people who haven't studied chess
extensively.
