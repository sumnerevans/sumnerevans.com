Today we left for Washington D.C. I drove mom and dad headed to the airport
early this morning, while Hannah and I stayed home so that we could attend a
friend's graduation brunch.

Hannah and I ended up leaving for the airport at around 13:00, arriving at
around 14:00, and getting through security with no problems. We had nearly two
hours before our 16:20 flight. Unfortunately for us, however, the flight was
massively delayed. The incoming plane was stuck in Dallas for a few hours, and
could not make it to Denver in time. The plane ended up departing at 18:40
(MST).

I'm on the plane right now, and we should arrive at Ronald Regan Airport around
00:10 (EST) tomorrow morning, and then we have to find the hotel. Hopefully we
don't have any more travel hiccups.
