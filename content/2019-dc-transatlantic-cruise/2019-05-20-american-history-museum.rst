Today we went to the American History Museum.

general thoughts:

- the general theme of the museum was that America was founded on certain
  ideals, and that over the years we have worked to defend those ideals, as well
  as include more people in those ideals.

- We have failed at both; and continue to try and figure out what the ideals
  mean in our lives today

- Flag was cool
