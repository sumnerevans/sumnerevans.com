​Today we went on a car tour through Prince Edward Island and then we
walked around a bit in downtown Charlottetown.

### Car Tour

Our guide took us on a large loop around the center of Price Edward
Island (PEI). If you think of the island as a U with the straight parts
lopped off but fat in the middle, you have a pretty good idea of what
the shape of the island is. It takes about 5 hours to drive from one end
to the other. We drove around the right part of the “fat” part of the
island. We drove north to the North Shore then along the shore before
curving back around and driving back to Charlottetown.

The countryside was very pretty. Here are a few photos.

#### North Shore

On the North Shore, we went to a few fishing villages. The fishing
villages have existed for a long time and basically consist of small
huts along a dock area. The huts primarily house repair workshops for
the fishermen. Fishing and lobster, oyster and mussel trapping are huge
industries on PEI and there are many old traditions around it. One that
our guide told us about was that on the first day of the fishing season,
the elder fisherman in the fishing village leads everyone out of the
harbor in a procession before dispersing to set their traps.

#### Beaches

The North Shore is also known for its beaches. Because of the Gulf
Stream, the waters around PEI are actually fairly warm during the summer
and many people go there to spend time at the beach. We stopped at one
spot but the wind was so hard that the sand was flying up and hitting us
in the face! We rapidly returned to the car.

Here’s a picture I took at a different beach where we were not getting
sandblasted.

#### Anne of Green Gables

On our way back to Charlottetown we stopped at Lucy Maud Montgomery’s
house, the house where Anne of Green Gables was based. I’m no fan of the
series, so I won’t dwell on the subject.

### Walking City

After our tour, we went back to the boat for lunch and returned to the
city to walk around. There are a few paths marked in paint on the
sidewalks kinda like the Freedom Trail in Boston. We roughly followed
the Historical Walk which took us past the the most important historical
parts of town.

The first stop on our tour was a beautiful church.

Across the street was a nice row of what I presume are homes.

At the end of that street is Confederation Hall, the birthplace of
Canada. It was in that building that the founders of Canada met to
discuss becoming a nation in 1864.

We turned left in front of Confederation Hall and walked down Victoria
Row, a pedestrian street somewhat like 16th Street Mall in Denver but
much shorter (only one city block). Then we walked over through an older
district of town with many nice, old houses.

Our last stop was Cow’s, a famous local ice cream store. They are famous
for their chocolate covered potato chips and we tried to get a sample,
but they didn’t give us one :(. We made up for it by getting some of
their ice cream.

After that, it was time to head back to the ship, but before we got
back, we walked along some of the boardwalk and got this nice picture of
the ship.

### Evening

#### Dinner with the Captain’s Parents

The evening was very similar to the other evenings, but we had some very
interesting table mates at dinner. We ate with the ship captain’s
parents. We figure that we are related because their last name is
O’Driscoll and they are from Cork, Ireland. We have relatives on mom’s
side of the family from the same place.

The father was a captain himself. He worked on fishing boats. His wife
is a farmer.

They have a very deep Irish accent, so much so that it was difficult to
understand them at times. It often sounded like they were speaking
German instead of English. English is a Germanic Language, so likely the
English dialect in Ireland has been influenced less by French through
the ages. It has also probably retained a bunch of the Celtic influence
(Celtic is another Germanic Language). (Linguistics is a very
fascinating study, you can really learn a lot about history by examining
the similarities between languages.)

#### Going Under Confederation Bridge

During dinner, we were approaching Confederation Bridge, a 13 km (8 mi)
long bridge connecting PEI to mainland New Brunswick. When we got close,
the captain’s father and I went up to the top deck and watched us sail
under the bridge. While we were up there, I got some great pictures of
the sunset and of Confederation Bridge.

#### Meeting the Captain

Near the end of dinner, Captain Noel O’Driscoll, the captain of the
ship, came by to say hello to his parents. We were introduced to him and
had a nice conversation. During our conversation we asked him how much
clearance we had under Confederation Bridge. He said two metres (6.6
ft). For a ship of our size, that’s not that much clearance. In fact,
they had to lower one of the ship’s antennas to be able to pass under
safely. I was able to get a picture with the Captain and his father.

#### Beautiful Sunset

At the tail end of dinner there was a beautiful sunset. These pictures
really don’t do it justice.
