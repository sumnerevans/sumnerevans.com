Today we arrived in Bermuda, went to a beach and walked some in the town
of Hamilton.

After breakfast this morning, I went down to the library to see if there
was anyone who wanted to play chess. There was a guy, David, who wanted
to play. He was very good (at least compared to me). He won all three
games we played.

### Arrival in Bermuda {#arrivalinbermuda}

As we were playing, the ship was being navigated through the straight at
the entrance to the harbor. The straight is very narrow and our ship,
the Veendam, is the largest ship that can navigate the straight safely.
The ship is extremely maneuverable and we even did a 180 in an area with
only enough room for the length of the vessel to dock the proper
direction. In all, navigating the channel, docking and getting clearance
from the port authority took about three hours.

### Church Beach {#churchbeach}

We disembarked at about 13:30 (1:30 PM) and got a bus to the far side of
the island where there were some nice beaches. The beach we chose was
called Church Beach. Mom had gotten advice from one of the people on the
ship about what beach would be best to go to and he suggested that one
for snorkeling. He didn’t mention that we had to rent gear in Hamilton
and so we arrived at the beach without gear. I went a little bit into
the water, but we didn’t snorkel.

The water was extremely blue. Whenever I’ve see the pictures in travel
magazines of blue oceans, I thought they were touched up. They aren’t.
It was beautiful.

### Back at the Ship {#backattheship}

After the beach, we took the bus back to Hamilton. It was almost time
for dinner at this point so we went to our cabin to get ready to eat. We
ate with two couples, one from the East Coast and the other from
California. Conversation was interesting, but I’m glad that we are doing
open seating where we have different people every night.

We finished dinner and I went up to the Crow’s Nest to work on my blog.
Then I went to the Piano Guy, Barry from Boston, who is really good and
very entertaining.

Anyway, I’m going to continue listening to the music. Tomorrow is
Bermuda Day so there will be a parade in the town. We are going to try
and do something in the morning before the parade, but we aren’t quite
sure how crazy it will be with the holiday.
