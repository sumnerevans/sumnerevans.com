Today we were in Bar Harbor, Maine (pronounced Baahh Haahhhbahh). Bar
Harbor is know for its lobster but it is also near Acadia National Park.

### Bike Tour {#biketour}

We did a bike tour through the park. The park came to be through large
donations from John D. Rockefeller Jr. and a few other men. They bought
up the land, preventing it from being developed. After cars were
introduced to the island, Rockefeller built a road around the entire
park and built separate carriage roads where no motorised vehicles are
allowed. They were named carriage roads because horse-drawn carriages
are allowed. Throughout the park, the car road and the carriage road
intersect in multiple places and in those places, Rockefeller had
bridges built to ensure that people on the carriage roads didnâ€™t have to
deal with cars. Our tour went on these carriage roads. I think it is
best to just post a bunch of pictures and let them speak for themselves.

### Walking in Town {#walkingintown}

After our bike tour, we walked around the town of Bar Harbor. We ate
lunch at a local restaurant that served lobster rolls (basically lobster
sandwiches). I had one and it was very good. We walked around the town
for a little while looking in the various stores and enjoying the town.
Then we headed back to the boat and the evening proceeded much like the
previous ones.
