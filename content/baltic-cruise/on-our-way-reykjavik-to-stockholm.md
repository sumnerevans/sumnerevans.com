**7:26 2015/7/23 Reykjavík, Iceland, 1:26 MST:** I am sitting on the
airplane getting ready to leave from Reykjavík for Stockholm right now.
We have another little kid behind us on this flight. I am hoping to not
sleep this flight so that I am closer to Stockholm time (we will be
arriving there at 12:30 local time). We will see how that goes.

I think it’s really interesting flying on international flights. There
are so many people from different countries speaking different
languages, it’s really very cool. In these multilingual situations I
think of Heaven. I imagine that Heaven will sound like the UN except not
so argumentative. Every tongue and every nation bowing before the throne
of the Almighty God of the Universe. It’s gonna be amazing. I can just
see a South African Christian and a North Korean Christian glorifying
God together with one voice. Obviously the best thing about Heaven is
that our Savior will be there, but I think the second best thing about
heaven will be seeing all of the people who have virtually nothing in
common, united in the only thing that truly matters.

It’s sorta weird, but In these multilingual situations, I feel called to
be a witness to the people around me, even more so than when I am at
home. I also feel helpless because I can’t communicate with them. Maybe
that’s why the burden to be a light for Christ is stronger, I don’t
know. All I know is that i want to have this same calling when at home
as I do away from home.

Right now I have made smile-friends with a little boy sitting across the
isle from us. It looks like his family is from America (at least that’s
my guess since his mom is reading a book with an English title). He
looks like he is full of energy. Not so much his mom. They almost had a
catastrophe involving a bottle of juice… luckily the container was
empty.

We now have our own food. One interesting thing about Iceland Air is
that food isn’t included in the price of the flight. You can buy food,
but it’s not included. The cost is sorta offset by the fact that they
give you 2 free checked bags. I got a baguette which is surprisingly
good for airplane food. I also got 7-up. This time they gave me a cup
and a full bottle of 7-up.

am literally typing just to stay awake so I apologize if this is too
lengthy. I am determined to stay awake until 19:00 Stockholm time which
is a full 9 hours away, so you are probably going to have to deal with a
few more posts.
