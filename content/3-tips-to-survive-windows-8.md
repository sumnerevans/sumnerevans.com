If you got a computer within the past few months, you probably have a
computer with [Windows
8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8 "Windows 8"){.zem_slink}. If
you got one at
[Christmas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas "Christmas"){.zem_slink},
it is almost sure to be one with Win8 (unless the people who gave you
the computer *intentionally* put Win7 on it). Random comment alert, I
think that a lot of people who got a new computer for Christmas
(especially the less young) were a little disappointed with the loss of
their start button. Just a though. Anyway, about survival. Here are a
few things that will help you get started with Windows 8.

1.  ### Charms and the Charm Bar

    #### What is it?

    The charm bar is the go-to spot if you want to search, share, or get
    to your settings.<!--more--> It is also a way to get back to the
    [Start
    Screen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_menu "Start menu"){.zem_slink}
    and a way to project to another monitor and do other things with
    [peripheral
    devices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral "Peripheral"){.zem_slink}.

    #### How do I get to it?

    **Mouse:** Move your
    [mouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_%28computing%29 "Mouse (computing)"){.zem_slink}
    to the top-right or bottom-right corner of your screen and then move
    your
    [cursor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_%28computers%29 "Cursor (computers)"){.zem_slink}
    down along the right edge.

    **Touch:** Swipe from the right side of the screen.

    #### Why is this helpful to me?

    <p>
    When not in an app, you will be able to search for files, settings,
    apps, and even search inside apps. You can also access common
    settings. In an app, you get all of the aforementioned features as
    well as in-app settings, be able to search the app and other app
    specific tasks.

2.  ### The Modern [Task Bar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskbar "Taskbar"){.zem_slink}

    #### What is it?

    The Modern Task bar is the new way of task switching that was
    implemented by
    [Microsoft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft"){.zem_slink}
    in Windows 8.

    #### How do I get to it?

    **Mouse:** Move your cursor to the top-left corner of the screen.
    You can then start clicking to cycle through all of your open apps,
    or, if you have more than two apps open, you can move the cursor
    down the left side of the screen to display more open apps.

    **Touch:** Swipe from the left side of the screen to cycle through
    all of your open apps. Swipe from the left side of the screen and
    then swipe back without lifting your finger to get the Modern Task
    Bar.

    #### Why is this helpful to me?

    <p>
    This is the way that you can switch between open Metro apps in
    Windows 8. (You can also use Win + Tab to switch between Metro Apps.
    [Alt +
    Tab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-Tab "Alt-Tab"){.zem_slink}
    does the same thing as Win + Tab except it includes desktop apps.)

3.  ### Start Screen

    #### What is it?

    Think of the Start Screen as a fullscreen Start Menu. It does all of
    the things that the old Start Menu did. You can search from it, run
    apps from it, access Computer from it, etc. I will make posts on all
    of those features on this blog.

    #### How do I get to it?

    **Mouse:** Move your cursor to the bottom left corner (where the
    Start Button used to be) and when a little picture of the Start
    Screen pops up, click.

    **Keyboard:** Press the
    [Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows"){.zem_slink}
    key. (It looks like the Windows logo.)

    <p>
    **Touch:** Open the Charm Bar (see above) and tap on "Start". It's
    the button that looks like the Windows logo and is the only colored
    one on the bar.
